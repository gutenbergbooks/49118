<p class="pc mid">FOURTH CRUSADE.</p>

<p class="pc lmid">A.D. 1195-1198.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">When</span> we cast a retrospective glance over the periods we
have described, we congratulate ourselves upon not having
lived in those times of war and trouble; but when we look
around us, and reflect upon the age of which we form a part,
we fear we have little reason to boast over the epochs commonly
termed barbarous. During twenty-five years a revolution,
born of opinions unknown to past ages, has pervaded
cities, agitated nations, and shaken thrones. This revolution
has for auxiliaries war and victory; it strengthens itself with
all the obstacles that are opposed to it; it is for ever born
again from itself, and when we believe we can perceive the
end of its ravages, it re-appears more terrible and menacing
than ever. At the moment in which I resume the account
of the Crusades,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> the spirit of sedition and revolt, the
fanaticism of modern doctrines, which seemed to slumber,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
all at once awake, and again threaten the world with universal
disorder; nations which tremble for their liberty and
their laws, are aroused, and spring up in arms; a coalition
of all kings and of all nations, a general crusade is formed
not to defend the tomb of Christ, but to preserve that which
Europe possesses of its ancient civilization. It is amidst
the rumours of a new revolution, of a formidable war, that
I am about to describe the revolutions and wars that disturbed
the East and the West in the middle ages. May I,
whilst deploring the calamities of my country, profit by the
events of which I am a witness, and by the frightful spectacle
which is before my eyes, to paint with greater truth
the passions and the troubles of a remote age, and revive
in the hearts of my contemporaries a love of concord and
peace.</p>

<p>The death of Saladin was followed by that which almost
always is to be observed in the dynasties of the East,&mdash;a reign
of agitation and trouble succeeding a reign of strength and
absolute power. In these dynasties, which have no other
support but victory, and the all-powerful will of a single
man, as long as the sovereign, surrounded by his soldiers,
commands, he is tremblingly obeyed; but as soon as he has
closed his eyes, his people precipitate themselves towards
license with the same ardour that they had yielded to servitude;
and passions, long restrained by the presence of the
despot, only blaze forth with the greater violence when there
remains nothing of him but a vain remembrance.</p>

<p>Saladin gave no directions respecting the order of succession,
and by this want of foresight prepared the ruin of his
empire. One of his sons, Alaziz,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> who commanded in
Egypt, caused himself to be proclaimed sultan of Cairo;
another<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> took possession of the sovereignty of Aleppo, and
a third of the principality of Amath.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Malek-Adel, the
brother of Saladin, assumed the throne of Mesopotamia,
and the countries in the neighbourhood of the Euphrates.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
The principal emirs, and all the princes of the race of the
Ayoubites, made themselves masters of the cities and
provinces of which they held the command.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Afdhal,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> eldest son of Saladin, was proclaimed sultan of
Damascus. Master of Syria, and of the capital of a vast empire,
sovereign of Jerusalem and Palestine,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> he appeared to have
preserved something of the power of his father; but all fell
into disorder and confusion. The emirs, the old companions
of the victories of Saladin, endured with reluctance the
authority of the young sultan. Several refused to take
the oath of obedience,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> drawn up by the cadis of Damascus;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
others consented to take it, but on condition that their fiefs
should be secured to them, or that new ones should be
bestowed upon them. Far from labouring to reduce the
power of this haughty soldiery, Afdhal neglected the duties
of his throne for the pleasures of debauchery, to which he
gave himself up entirely, abandoning the welfare of his
empire to a vizier,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> who rendered him odious to the
Mussulmans. The army demanded the dismissal of the
vizier, whom they accused of having usurped the authority of
the prince: the vizier, on his part, advised his master to
banish the seditious emirs. The weak sultan, who only saw
with the eyes of his minister, annoyed by the presence and
complaints of a discontented army, dismissed from his service
a great number of soldiers and emirs, who went among
all the neighbouring princes, complaining of his ingratitude,
and accusing him of forgetting, in the bosom of idleness
and effeminacy, the holy laws of the prophet and the glory
of Saladin.</p>

<p>The greater number of them, who went into Egypt,
exhorted Alaziz to take arms against his brother. The
sultan of Cairo gave ear to their advice, and under the pretence
of avenging the glory of his father, conceived the
project of possessing himself of Damascus. He assembled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
his forces, and marched into Syria at the head of an army.
At the approach of danger, Afdhal invoked assistance from
the princes that reigned over the countries of Amath and
Aleppo. Soon a formidable war blazed forth, into which
was dragged the whole of the family of the Ayoubites.
Alaziz laid siege to Damascus. The hopes of an easy conquest
animated his emirs, and made them believe that they
were fighting in a just cause; but as they at first had but
little success, and as victory seemed every day to fly further
from their banners, the war began to appear to them unjust.
At first they murmured; then they revolted from Alaziz,
and at length rejoined the troops of Syria. The sultan of
Cairo, upon being thus abandoned, was obliged to raise the
siege disgracefully, and return into Egypt. The sultans of
Damascus and Aleppo pursued him across the desert, with
the design of attacking him in his capital. Afdhal, at the
head of a victorious army, soon carried terror to the banks of
the Nile. Alaziz was about to be dethroned, and Egypt to be
conquered by the Syrians, if the brother of Saladin, guided
by a policy, whose motive might be easily divined, had not
opposed the authority of his counsels to the arms of the
conqueror, and re-established peace in the family of the
Ayoubites.</p>

<p>The princes and emirs respected the experience of Malek-Adel,
and allowed him to be the arbitrator of their differences.
The warriors of Syria and Egypt, accustomed to
see him in camps, looked upon him as their leader, and
followed him with joy to battle; whilst nations, that he had
often astonished by his exploits, invoked his name in their
reverses and dangers. The Mussulmans now perceived
with surprise that he had been in a manner exiled in
Mesopotamia, and that an empire, founded by his valour,
was abandoned to young princes who bore no name among
warriors: he himself grew secretly indignant at not having
received due recompense for his labours, and was aware of
all that the old soldiers, he had so often led to victory, might
one day do to further his ambitious views. It was important
to his designs that too much of the empire should not be in
the same hands, and that the provinces should remain for
some time longer shared by two rival powers. The peace
which he had brought about could not be of long duration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
and the discord ever on the point of breaking out among
his nephews, must soon offer him an opportunity of reaping
the rich harvest of the vast heritage of Saladin.</p>

<p>Afdhal, warned by the dangers he had run, resolved to
change his conduct. Hitherto he had scandalized all faithful
Mussulmans by his intemperance in the use of wine.
Aboulfeda, who was descended from the family of Saladin,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
says, in his history, that the sultan of Damascus, during the
early years of his reign, passed his life amidst banquets and
indulgence, taking delight in nothing but listening to songs
and composing verses. On his return from Egypt, Afdhal
exhibited an entire alteration in his manners; but he only
fell from one excess into another; he was now constantly at
prayers, or employed in the most minute practices of the
Mussulman religion; but, in his excessive devotion, as in
his dissipated life, he was perfectly inattentive to the duties
of a monarch, and submitted himself, without reserve, to
the counsels of the same vizier who had already nearly cost
him his dominions. “Then,” says Aboulfeda, “complaints
against him were heard from all quarters, and tongues that
had been loud in his praise became silent.”</p>

<p>Alaziz thought this opportunity favourable for again
taking up arms against his brother; and Malek-Adel, persuaded
that war was most likely to minister to his ambition,
no longer advocated peace, but placed himself at the head of
the army of Egypt. Having intimidated by his threats, or
won by his presents, the principal emirs of Afdhal, he at
once took possession of Damascus in the name of Alaziz,
and soon governed as sovereign the richest provinces of
Syria.</p>

<p>Every day fresh quarrels broke out among the emirs and
princes; all those who had fought with Saladin, thought the
moment was come at which to put forth and establish their
pretensions; and the princes who still remained of the family
of Noureddin began to entertain hopes of regaining the
provinces wrested from the unfortunate Attabeks by the son
of Ayoub. All the East was in a state of fermentation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Bloody divisions desolated Persia, a prey to the various
claims of the feeble remains of the race of the Seljoucides.
The empire of the Carismians, which conquest was every
day extending, threatened at the same time the capital of
Corosan and the city of Bagdad, in which the pontiff of the
Mussulman religion lived in perpetual fear. For a long
time the caliphs had been unable to take any active part in
the events that changed the face of Syria; and the only
authority they possessed was exercised in consecrating the
victories of the triumphant party, whoever that might be.
Afdhal, driven from Damascus, called in vain upon the
caliph of Bagdad for protection; all that shadow of power
could afford him was a recommendation to exercise patience,
and an assurance “<i>that his enemies would have to render an
account to God of what they had done</i>.”</p>

<p>Among the rivalries that convulsed the Mussulman states,
Malek-Adel met with no obstruction to his projects; the
troubles and disorders which his usurpation gave birth to,
even the wars undertaken against him, all contributed to the
consolidation and extension of his unjustly-obtained power.
It became evident that he must soon unite under his sway
the greater part of the provinces conquered by Saladin.
Thus was verified, for the second time within a few years,
the observation of an Arabian historian, who expressed
himself in the following words when speaking of the succession
of Noureddin: “<i>The greater part of the founders
of empires have not been able to leave them to their posterity.</i>”
This instability of power is not a thing to be wondered at
in countries where success renders everything legitimate,
where the caprices of fortune are frequently laws, and
where the most formidable enemies of an empire founded
by arms, are the very men whose bravery has assisted in
raising it. The historian we have quoted, deplores the revolutions
of military despotism, without duly searching for the
natural causes of them; and can explain so many changes
only by referring to the justice of God, always ready to
punish, at least in their children, all who have employed violence
or shed the blood of man to attain empire.</p>

<p>Such were the revolutions which, during many years,
agitated the Mussulman states of Syria and Egypt. The
fourth crusade, which we are about to describe, and in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the Christians might have greatly profited by the troubles
of the East, only served to reunite the scattered members
of the empire of Saladin. Malek-Adel owed the progress of
his power not only to the divisions of the Mussulmans, but
to the spirit of discord that reigned among the Christians.</p>

<p>After the departure of the king of England, as was
always the case at the termination of every crusade, the
Christian colonies, surrounded by perils, advanced more
rapidly to their fall. Henry of Champagne, charged with
the government of Palestine, disdained the title of king, as
he was impatient to return to Europe, and looked upon his
kingdom as a place of exile. The three military orders,
detained in Asia by their vows, constituted the principal
strength of a state which but lately had had all the warriors
of Europe for its defenders. Guy of Lusignan retired to
Cyprus, took no more interest in the fate of Jerusalem, and
had full occupation in keeping himself on his new throne,
shaken by the continual revolts of the Greeks and threatened
by the emperors of Constantinople.</p>

<p>Bohemond III., grandson of Raymond of Poictiers, and
descended, in the female line, from the celebrated Bohemond,
one of the heroes of the first crusade, governed the principality
of Antioch and the county of Tripoli. Amidst the
misfortunes that afflicted the Christian colonies, the sole aim
of this prince was the extension of his dominions, and every
means appeared to him good and just that could forward his
designs. Bohemond pretended to have claims to the principality
of Armenia; and employed by turns force and
stratagem to get possession of it. After several useless
attempts, he succeeded in decoying into his capital Rupin
of the Mountain, one of the princes of Armenia, and detained
him prisoner. Livon, the brother of Rupin, determined to
take signal vengeance for such an outrage; and, under the
pretence of treating for peace, invited Bohemond to repair
to the frontiers of Armenia. The two princes engaged by
oath to come without escort or train to the place of conference;
but each formed a secret design of laying a snare for
his adversary. The Armenian prince, better seconded by
either his genius or fortune, remained conqueror in this disgraceful
contest. Bohemond was surprised, loaded with
chains, and carried away to a fortress of Lesser Armenia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
The war was instantly renewed with fury; the people of
both Armenia and Antioch rushed to arms, and the countries
and cities of the two principalities were speedily by
turns invaded and ravaged. At length peace became desirable,
and after some disputes upon the conditions, the prince
of Antioch was sent back to his states, and Rupin of the
Mountain was restored to the nations of Armenia. By an
agreement entered into by the two princes, Alice, the daughter
of Rupin, married the eldest son of Bohemond. This
union promised to be the pledge of a durable peace; but
the germ of so many divisions still subsisted; the two parties
retained a strong feeling of the outrage they had received;
and every treaty of peace becoming a fresh subject
of discussion, war was always ready to be rekindled.</p>

<p>In another direction, ambition and jealousy set at variance
the orders of the Temple and St. John. At the period of
the third crusade, the Hospitallers and the Templars were as
powerful as sovereign princes; they possessed in Asia and
Europe villages, cities, and even provinces.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The two orders,
rivalling each other in power and glory, attended far less to
the defence of the holy places than to the augmentation of
their own renown and riches. Every one of their immense
possessions, every one of their prerogatives, the renown of
the knights, the credit of the leaders, all, even to the trophies
of their valour, were for them subjects of rivalry, and, at
length, this spirit of discord and jealousy produced an open,
war. A French gentleman, established in Palestine, possessed,
as a vassal of the Hospitallers, the castle of Margat,
situated towards the frontiers of Arabia. The Templars
pretended that this castle belonged to them, and took possession
of it by main force. Robert,&mdash;that was the name of
the gentleman,&mdash;carried his complaints to the Hospitallers,
who immediately flew to arms and drove the Templars from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the castle. From that time the knights of the two orders
never met without provoking each other to the combat
most of the Franks and Christians always taking a part in
the quarrel, some for the order of St. John, others for that
of the Temple. The king of Jerusalem and the most prudent
of the barons made many useless attempts to restore
peace; and several Christian princes endeavoured in vain to
reconcile the two rival orders. The pope himself had much
difficulty in getting his sacred mediation to be accepted; and
it was only after long debates that the Holy See, sometimes
armed with evangelical thunders, sometimes employing the
paternal language of the head of the Church, terminated, by
its wisdom and supreme ascendancy, a contest which the
knights themselves would have preferred deciding with
sword and lance.</p>

<p>During these fatal divisions none thought of defending
themselves against the general enemy, the Saracens. One
of the most melancholy consequences of the spirit of faction
is, that it always leads to a lamentable indifference for the
common cause. The more violently the parties attacked
each other, the less perception they seemed to have of the
dangers that threatened the Christian colonies; neither the
knights of the Temple or of St. John, nor the Christians of
Antioch or Ptolemaïs, ever thought of asking for succour
against the infidels; and history does not say that one person
was sent from the East to make Europe aware of the
griefs of Sion.</p>

<p>The situation of the Christians in Palestine was besides so
uncertain and perilous, that the wisest could form no idea of
coming events, or dare to adopt a resolution. If they
appealed afresh to the warriors of the West, they broke the
truce made with Saladin, and exposed themselves to all the
resentment of the infidels; if they respected treaties, the
truce might be broken by the Mussulmans, ever ready to
profit by the calamities which fell upon the Christians. In
this state of things, it appeared difficult to foresee a new
crusade, which was neither called for by the wishes of the
Christians of Asia, nor promoted by the interests of Europe.
In fact, when we cast our eyes over the Christian colonies
of the East, as they are described to us in these unhappy
times, and see the spirit of ambition and discord displacing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
in all hearts the holy spirit of the Gospel, we cannot wonder
that Christendom took so little interest in their fate. Again,
when contemporary history represents to us these colonies a
prey to license and division, and destitute of everything that
could render them flourishing, we can scarcely believe that
the West was again likely to lavish its wealth and its blood
to support and defend them. But the great name of Jerusalem
still produced a powerful effect upon the minds of all;
the remembrance of the first crusade still aroused the enthusiasm
of Christians; and the veneration for the holy places,
which appeared to grow weaker in the kingdom of Christ
itself, was yet cherished beyond the seas and in the principal
countries of the West.</p>

<p>Celestine III. had, by his exhortations, encouraged the
warriors of the third crusade; and, at the age of ninety,
pursued with zeal all the projects of his predecessors;
ardently wishing that the last days of his pontificate should
be illustrated by the conquest of Jerusalem. After the
return of Richard, the news of the death of Saladin had
spread joy throughout the West, and revived the hopes of
the Christians. Celestine wrote to all the faithful to inform
them that the most formidable enemy of Christendom had
ceased to live; and, without regarding the truce made by
Richard Cœur de Lion, he ordered his bishops and archbishops
to preach a new crusade in their dioceses.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The
sovereign pontiff promised all who would take the cross the
same privileges and the same advantages as in the preceding
crusades. The profanation of the holy places; the oppression
under which the faithful of the East groaned; the ever-increasing
insolence and audacity of the Saracens&mdash;such were
the motives by which he supported his holy exhortations.
He addressed himself particularly to the bishops of England,
and commanded them to use every persuasion to induce
Richard again to take up arms against the infidels.</p>

<p>Richard, although returned, had never laid aside the cross,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the symbol of pilgrimage; and it might be supposed he still
intended to repair again to the Holy Land; but, scarcely
escaped from an unjust captivity, taught by his own experience
how great were the difficulties and perils of a distant
enterprise, his thoughts and time were engrossed by his
endeavours to remedy his losses, to defend or aggrandize his
states, and to be on his guard against the insidious attempts
of Philip Augustus. His knights and barons, whom he
himself exhorted to resume the cross, professed, as he did, a
warm devotion for the cause of Jerusalem; but they could
not make up their minds to return to a country which had
been to them a place of suffering and exile.</p>

<p>Although the appearance of the preachers of the crusade
everywhere inspired respect, they had no better success in
France, where, only a few years before, a hundred thousand
warriors had been roused by the summons to defend the holy
places. If the fear of the enterprises of Philip was sufficient
to detain Richard in the West, the dread of the vindictive
and jealous disposition of Richard exercised the same influence
over Philip. The greater number of his knights and
nobles followed his example, and contented themselves with
shedding tears over the fate of Jerusalem. The enthusiasm
for the crusade was communicated to only a small number of
warriors, amongst whom history names the count de Montfort,
who afterwards conducted the cruel war against the
Albigeois.</p>

<p>From the commencement of the crusades, Germany had
never ceased to send its warriors to the defence of the Holy
Land. It deplored the recent loss of its armies, destroyed
or dispersed in Asia Minor, and the death of the Emperor
Frederick, who had gained nothing but a grave in the plains
of the East; but the remembrance of so great a disaster did
not extinguish in all hearts the zeal for the cause of Jerusalem.
Henry VI., who occupied the imperial throne, had
not partaken, as the kings of France and England had, the
perils and reverses of the last expedition. Unpleasant
remembrances or fears of his enemies in Europe could have
no effect in preventing him from joining in a new enterprise,
or deter him from a holy pilgrimage which so many illustrious
examples seemed to point out as a sacred duty.</p>

<p>Although this prince had been excommunicated by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Holy See, only the preceding year, the Pope sent an embassy
to him, charged with the duty of recalling to his mind the
example of his father Frederick, and urging him to assume
the cross. Henry, who sought every occasion to conciliate
the head of the Church, and who likewise entertained vast
projects in which a new crusade might be very serviceable,
received the envoy of Celestine with great honours.</p>

<p>Of all the princes of the middle ages, no one evinced more
ambition than Henry VI.; his imagination, say historians
was filled with the glory of the Cæsars, and he wished to be
able to say with Alexander, <i>all that my desires can embrace
belongs to me</i>. Tancred, a natural son of William II., king
of Sicily, chosen by the Sicilian nobility to succeed his
father, was recently deceased; and the emperor, who had
espoused Constance, the heiress of a throne founded by
Norman Crusaders, and desirous of establishing his claims,
judged that the time was come to carry out his designs and
achieve his conquests. The expedition of which the Holy
See desired him to be the leader, was exceedingly favourable
to his ambitious projects; when, promising to defend Jerusalem,
he only thought of the conquest of Sicily; and the
conquest of Sicily had no value in his estimation but as
opening the road to Greece and Constantinople.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> At the
same time that he professed entire submission to the will of
the head of the Church, he endeavoured to form an alliance
with the republics of Genoa and Venice, promising them the
spoils of the conquered; but in his mind he nourished the
hope that he should one day overthrow the Italian republics
and lower the authority of the Holy See, and upon their
remains revive, for himself and his family, the empire of
Augustus and Constantine.</p>

<p>Such was the prince to whom Celestine sent an embassy,
and whom he wished to persuade into a holy war. After
having announced his intention of taking the cross, Henry
convoked a general diet at Worms, in which he himself
exhorted the faithful to take up arms for the defence of
the holy places. Since Louis VII., king of France, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
harangued his subjects to induce them to join in the crusade,
Henry was the only monarch that had mingled his voice
with that of the preachers of the holy war, to make his subjects
acquainted with the sufferings and complaints of the
Church of Jerusalem. His eloquence, celebrated by the
historians of his time, but above all, the spectacle presented
of a great emperor himself preaching a holy war against the
infidels, made a profound impression upon the multitude of
his auditors.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> After this solemn address, the most illustrious
of the prelates assembled at Worms ascended the
evangelical pulpit to keep up the rapidly increasing enthusiasm
of the faithful; during eight hours nothing was
heard but the groans of Sion and the city of God. Henry,
surrounded by his court, assumed the symbol of the Crusaders; a
great number of German nobles followed his
example, some to please God, <i>and others to please the emperor</i>.
Among those who took the oath to combat the
Saracens, history names Henry duke of Saxony; Otho marquis
of Brandenburgh; Henry count palatine of the Rhine;
Herman landgrave of Thuringia; Henry duke of Brabant;
Albert count of Apsburg; Adolphus count of Schwemburg;
Henry count of Pappenhein, marshal of the empire; the duke
of Bavaria; Frederick, son of Leopold, duke of Austria;
Conrad marquis of Moravia; Valeran de Limbourg; and
the bishops of Wurtzburg, Bremen, Verdun, Habbastadt,
Passau, and Ratisbon.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>The crusade was preached in all the provinces of Germany,
and the letters of the emperor and the pope kindled
the zeal of the Christian warriors everywhere; never had an
enterprise against the infidels been undertaken under more
favourable auspices. As Germany undertook the crusade
almost singly, the glory of the German nations seemed as
much interested in this war as religion itself. Henry was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
to command the holy expedition; and the Crusaders, full of
confidence and hope, were preparing to follow him to the
East. But Henry entertained other views; several nobles
of his court, some who penetrated his secret designs, and
others who believed they offered him prudent advice, conjured
him to remain in the West, and direct the crusade
from the bosom of his dominions; and Henry, after a slight
resistance, yielded to their prayers, and gave his whole
attention to the hastening of the departure of the Crusaders.</p>

<p>The emperor of Germany placed himself at the head of
forty thousand men and took the route for Italy, where
everything was prepared for the conquest of Sicily; the
remainder of the Crusaders were divided into two armies,
which, proceeding by different roads, were to meet in Syria.
The first, commanded by the duke of Saxony and the duke
of Brabant, embarked at ports of the German Ocean and
the Baltic; the second crossed the Danube, and directed its
march towards Constantinople, whence the fleet of the
Greek emperor Isaac was to transport it to Ptolemaïs. To
this army, commanded by the archbishop of Mayence and
Valeran de Limbourg, were joined the Hungarians, who
accompanied their queen Margaret, sister to Philip Augustus.
The queen of Hungary, after having lost Bela her husband,
had made a vow to live only for Christ, and to end her days
in the Holy Land.</p>

<p>The Crusaders under the command of the archbishop of
Mayence and Valeran de Limbourg, were the first to arrive
in Palestine. Scarcely were they landed when they expressed
their desire and resolution to begin the war against
the infidels. The Christians, who were then at peace with
the Saracens, hesitated to break the truce signed by Richard,
and were, further, unwilling to give the signal for hostilities
before they could open the campaign with some hopes of
success. Henry of Champagne and the barons of Palestine
represented to the German Crusaders the danger to which
an imprudent rupture would expose the Christians of the
East, and conjured them to wait for the army of the dukes
of Saxony and Brabant. But the Germans, full of confidence
in their own strength, were indignant at having
obstacles thrown in the way of their valour by vain scruples<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and chimerical alarms; they were astonished that the Christians
of Palestine should thus refuse the assistance sent to
them by Providence itself, and added, in a tone of anger and
contempt, that warriors of the West were not accustomed
to defer the hour of battle, and that the pope had not induced
them to take up arms and the cross to remain in a
state of shameful inactivity. The barons and knights of the
Holy Land could not listen to such injurious speeches without
indignation, and replied to the German Crusaders that
they had neither solicited nor wished for their arrival; that
they were better acquainted than the northern warriors of
Europe with what was advantageous to the kingdom of
Jerusalem; that they had without any foreign succour
braved the greatest perils, and that when the proper moment
should arrive they knew how to prove their valour
otherwise than by words. Amidst such warm debates the
minds of both parties became daily more exasperated, and
the most cruel discord thus prevailed among the Christians
before war was declared against the infidels.</p>

<p>All at once the German Crusaders marched out in arms
from Ptolemaïs, and commenced hostilities by ravaging the
lands of the Saracens. At the first signal of war the Mussulmans
gathered together their forces; and the danger that
threatened them putting an end to their discord, from the
banks of the Nile and from the remotest parts of Syria
crowded hosts of warriors but lately armed against each
other, but who now, assembled under the same banners,
acknowledged no other enemies but the Christians.</p>

<p>Malek-Adel, towards whom all Mussulmans turned their
eyes when the defence of Islamism was the question, marched
from Damascus at the head of an army and repaired to Jerusalem,
where all the emirs of the adjoining provinces came
to take his orders. The Mussulman army, after dispersing
the Christians who had advanced towards the mountains of
Naplouse, laid siege to Jaffa.</p>

<p>In the third crusade much importance had been attached
to the conservation of this city. Richard Cœur de Lion had
fortified it at great expense, and when that prince returned
to Europe he left a numerous garrison in it. Of all the
maritime places, Jaffa was nearest to the city which was
the object of the wishes of the faithful; if it remained in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the hands of the Christians, a road was always open for them
to Jerusalem, and the means of laying siege to that place
were rendered more easy; but if it fell into the power of the
Mussulmans, it gave them proportionate advantages for the
defence of the holy city.</p>

<p>When it was known at Ptolemaïs that the city of Jaffa
was threatened, Henry of Champagne, with his barons and
knights, immediately took arms to defend it, and joined the
German Crusaders, giving all their energies to the prosecution
of a war which they found could now no longer be
deferred or avoided. The three military orders, with the
troops of the kingdom, were about to set forward on their
march, when a tragical accident once more plunged the
Christians in grief, and retarded the effects of the happy
harmony which had been re-established at the approach of
peril. Henry of Champagne, leaning against a window of
his palace, at which he had placed himself to see his army
defile from the city, the window all at once gave way, and
in its fall precipitated him with it.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The unfortunate prince
expired in sight of his soldiers, who, instead of following
him to battle, accompanied him to his grave, and lost several
days in celebrating his funeral obsequies. The Christians of
Ptolemaïs were still weeping the death of their king, when
the misfortune they dreaded increased their grief and consternation;
the garrison of Jaffa having attempted a sortie,
had fallen into an ambuscade, and all the warriors that composed
it were either killed or taken prisoners. The Mussulmans
entered the city almost without resistance, and
twenty thousand Christians were put to the sword.</p>

<p>These disasters had been foreseen by all who had dreaded
the breaking of the truce; but the barons and knights of
Palestine lost no time in vain regrets, or in the utterance of
useless complaints, and looked with eager impatience for the
arrival of the Crusaders who had set out from the ports of
the Ocean and the Baltic. These troops had stopped on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
coast of Portugal, where they had defeated the Moors, and
taken from them the city of Silves. Proud of their triumph
over the infidels, they landed at Ptolemaïs at the moment
the people were lamenting the loss of Jaffa and crowding to
the churches to implore the mercy of Heaven.</p>

<p>The arrival of the new Crusaders restored hope and joy
to the Christians, and they resolved to lose no time, but to
march at once against the infidels. The army left Ptolemaïs
and advanced towards the coast of Syria, whilst a numerous
fleet kept along shore, loaded with provisions and
warlike stores. The Crusaders, without seeking the army
of Malek-Adel, laid siege to Berytus.</p>

<p>The city of Berytus, at an equal distance between Jerusalem
and Tripoli, by the commodiousness of its port, its
large population, and its commerce, had become the rival of
Ptolemaïs and Tyre. The Mussulman provinces of Syria
acknowledged it as their capital, and it was in Berytus that
the emirs, who contended for the lordship of the neighbouring
cities, came to display the pomp of their coronations.
After the taking of Jerusalem, Saladin was here saluted
sovereign of the city of God, and crowned sultan of Damascus
and Cairo. The pirates, who infested the seas,
brought to this city all the spoils of the Christians; the
Mussulman warriors there deposited the riches acquired by
conquest or brigandage; and the Frank captives, made in
late wars, were crowded together in the prisons of Berytus;
so that the Christians had powerful motives for endeavouring
to get possession of this place, and the Mussulmans had no
less urgent ones for defending it.</p>

<p>Malek-Adel, after having destroyed the fortifications of
Jaffa, advanced with his army as far as the mountains of
Anti-Libanus, on the route to Damascus; but on hearing
of the march and determination of the Crusaders, he crossed
the mountains on his left, and drew near to the coast: the
two armies met on the plain watered by the river Eleuthera,
between Tyre and Sidon. The trumpets soon sounded to
battle; the army of the Saracens, which covered an immense
space, endeavoured at first to surround the Franks, and
then to get between them and the coast; their cavalry precipitated
itself by turns on the flanks, the van, and the rear
of the Christians. The Christians closed their battalions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and on all sides presented impenetrable ranks. Whilst their
enemies showered arrows and darts upon them, their lances
and swords were bathed in the blood of the Saracens. They
fought with different arms, but with the same bravery and
fury. The victory remained for a long time uncertain; the
Christians were several times on the point of losing the
battle; but their obstinate valour at length triumphed over
all the resistance of the Mussulmans, and the sea-coast, the
banks of the river Eleuthera, and the declivities of the
mountains were covered with dead. The Saracens lost a
great many of their emirs. Malek-Adel, who displayed,
during the whole of this day, the skill of a great captain,
was wounded on the field of battle, and only owed his safety
to flight. All his army was dispersed; some fled towards
Jerusalem, whilst others hurried along the road to Damascus,
whither the news of this bloody defeat carried
consternation and despair.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>In consequence of this victory, all the cities on the coast
of Syria, which still belonged to the Mussulmans, fell into
the power of the Christians; the Saracens abandoned Sidon,
Laodicea, and Giblet. When the Christian fleet and army
appeared before Berytus, the garrison was surprised, and
did not venture to offer any resistance. This city contained,
say historians, more provisions than would have sufficed
for the inhabitants during three years; two large vessels,
add the same chronicles, could not have contained the bows,
arrows, and machines of war that were found in the city of
Berytus. In this conquest immense riches fell into the
hands of the victors, but the most precious reward of their
triumph doubtless was the deliverance of nine thousand
captives, impatient to resume their arms, and avenge the
outrages of their long captivity. The prince of Antioch,
who had joined the Christian army, sent a dove<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
capital to announce to all the inhabitants of the principality
the miraculous victory gained by the soldiers of the cross.
In all the Christian cities thanks were offered up to the
God of armies. The historians, who have transmitted to us
the account of these glorious events, in order to paint the
transports of the Christian people, content themselves with
repeating these words of holy writ: “<i>Then Sion leaped with
joy, and the children of Judah were filled with delight.</i>”</p>

<p>Whilst the Crusaders were thus pursuing their triumphs
in Syria, the emperor Henry VI. took advantage of all the
means and all the powers that the crusade had placed in his
hands, to achieve the conquest of the kingdoms of Naples and
Sicily. Although, in the course of his victories, he unceasingly
invoked religion, humanity, and justice, he only listened to
the dictates of his ambition; and, tormented by the sentiment
of an implacable revenge, he was neither touched by the
misery of the conquered, nor the submission of his enemies.
All who had shown any respect or any fidelity for the family
of Tancred, were cast by his orders into dungeons, or
perished in horrible tortures, which he himself had invented.
The army he led but too well seconded his gloomy and
savage policy; the peace which the conquerors boasted of
having restored to the people of Sicily, caused them more
evils, and made more victims than war itself. Falcandus,
who died some years before this expedition, had deplored
beforehand, in his history, the misfortunes that were about
to desolate his country. He already saw the most flourishing
cities and the rich country of Sicily laid waste by the
irruption of the barbarians. “Oh! unfortunate Sicilians,”
cried he, “it would be less frightful for you still to endure
the tyrants of old Syracuse, than to live under the empire
of this savage nation, which advances to invade your territory,
and plunge you into all the horrors of misery and
slavery.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, these pitiless soldiers wore the crosses of
pilgrims; and their emperor, although not yet relieved
from his excommunication, arrogated to himself glory as the
first of the soldiers of Christ.  Henry VI. was considered
as the head of the crusade, and supreme arbiter of the
affairs of the East.  The king of Cyprus offered to become
his vassal; Livon, prince of Armenia, begged the title of
king of him.  The emperor of Germany having no more
enemies to dread in the West, gave his whole attention
to the war against the Saracens, and in a letter addressed
to all the nobles, magistrates, and bishops of his empire,
exhorted them to hasten the departure of the Crusaders.
The emperor undertook to keep up an army of fifty thousand
men for one year, and promised to pay thirty ounces of
gold to every one that should remain under his banners till
the end of the holy war.  A great number of warriors,
seduced by this promise, entered into an engagement to
cross the sea, and fight against the infidels.  Henry had no
further need of them for his own conquests, and therefore
pressed their departure for the East.  Conrad, bishop of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Hildesheim, chancellor of the empire, whose counsels in the
wars of Sicily had but too well aided the ambition and barbarous
policy of his master, was charged with the task of
leading the third army of the Crusaders into Syria.</p>

<p>The arrival of so powerful a reinforcement in Palestine
rekindled the zeal and enthusiasm of the Christians, and it
might be expected that they would signalize their arms by
some great enterprise. The victory they had recently gained
in the plains of Tyre, the taking of Berytus, Sidon, and
Giblet, had struck the Mussulmans with terror. Some of
the leaders of the Christian army proposed to march against
Jerusalem. “That city,” said they, “cannot resist our
victorious arms; her governor is a nephew of Saladin, who
endures with impatience the authority of the sultan of
Damascus, and has often appeared disposed to listen to the
propositions<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> of the Christians.” Most of the barons did
not, however, partake in this hope, and placed no confidence
in the words of the Mussulmans. It was well known, that
the infidels, after the departure of Richard Cœur de Lion,
had very considerably augmented the fortifications of Jerusalem;<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
that a triple wall, and ditches of great depth, must
render this conquest more perilous, and particularly more
difficult, than in the time of Godfrey of Bouillon. Winter
was approaching; the Christian army might be overtaken by
the rainy season, and forced to raise the siege in face of the
army of the Saracens. These considerations determined the
Crusaders to put off the attack of the holy city to the
following year.</p>

<p>It is not impertinent to remark here, that in the Christian
armies they were constantly talking about Jerusalem,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
but that the leaders as constantly directed their efforts and
their arms to the acquisition of other conquests. The holy
city, situated far from the sea, contained within its walls no
other treasures but religious relics and monuments. The
maritime cities of Asia could boast of more worldly wealth,
and held out far greater advantages to the conquerors; they
afforded, likewise, more easy communication with Europe;
and if the conquest of Jerusalem sometimes tempted the
piety and devotion of the pilgrims, that of cities bordering
upon the sea, constantly kept awake the ambition of the
maritime and warlike nations of the West.</p>

<p>All the sea-coast from Antioch to Ascalon belonged to the
Christians; the Mussulmans having only been able to keep
possession of Thoron. The garrison of this fortress frequently
made incursions into the neighbouring countries,
and by continual hostilities, intercepted the communication
between the Christian cities. The Crusaders resolved that
before they set out for Jerusalem, they would lay siege to
the castle of Thoron. This fortress, built by Hugh de Saint-Omer,
in the reign of Baldwin II., was situated at some
leagues from Tyre, on the summit of a mountain, between
the chain of Libanus and the sea. It was only accessible
across steep rocks, and by a narrow way bordered by precipices.
The Christian army had no machines sufficiently
lofty to reach the heights of the walls, and arrows or stones
hurled from the foot of the mountain, could not injure the
besieged; whilst beams and fragments of rock precipitated
from the ramparts, made dreadful havoc among the besiegers.
In the early attacks, the Saracens ridiculed the vain efforts
of their enemies, and witnessed, almost without danger to
themselves, prodigies of valour, and the most murderous inventions
of the art of sieges, exercised ineffectually against
their walls. But the almost insurmountable difficulties that
might have been supposed likely to arrest the progress of
the Christians, only redoubled their ardour and courage.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
They every day made fresh attacks, each day seeming to increase
their efforts, and their obstinate bravery was seconded
by newly-invented machines of war. With incredible labour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
they dug out the earth, and made themselves a way across
the rocks; whilst some Saxons, who had worked in the mines
of Rammesberg, were employed in opening the flank of the
mountain. The Crusaders at length reached the bottom of
the ramparts of the fortress; the walls, the foundations of
which they demolished, began to shake in various parts,
without being struck by the ram, and their fall, which
seemed delayed by a miracle, filled the besieged with dread.</p>

<p>The Mussulmans now losing all hope of defending themselves,
proposed to capitulate; but such was the disorder of
the Christian army, with its multitude of leaders, that not
one of them durst take upon himself to listen to the proposals
of the infidels. Henry, palatine of the Rhine, and
the dukes of Saxony and Brabant, who enjoyed great consideration
among the Germans, could enforce obedience from
none but their own soldiers. Conrad, chancellor of the empire,
who represented the emperor of Germany, might have
been able to exercise beneficial power; but, weakened by
disease, without experience in war, always shut up in his
tent, he awaited the issue of the contest, and did not even
deign to be present at the councils of the princes and
barons. When the besieged had come to the determination
to capitulate, they remained several days without knowing
to which prince it would be most proper to address themselves,
and when their deputies came to the Christian camp,
their propositions were heard in a general assembly, in which
the spirit of rivalry, short-sighted zeal, and blind enthusiasm
held much greater empire than reason and prudence.</p>

<p>The Saracens, in their speech, confined themselves to imploring
the clemency of their conquerors; they promised to
abandon the fort with all their wealth, and only asked life
and liberty as the price of their submission. The suppliant
attitude of the Saracens must have touched the pride of the
Christian warriors; religion and policy united to procure a
favourable answer to the proposals that were made to them,
and the greater part of the leaders were disposed to sign the
capitulation. But some of the most ardent could not see
without indignation that it was wished to obtain by treaty
that which they must soon gain by force of arms. “It is
necessary,” said they, “that all our enemies should be struck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
with terror; and if the garrison of this place perish by the
sword, the affrighted Saracens will not dare to wait for us
either in Jerusalem or the other cities still in their possession.”</p>

<p>As their advice was not adopted, these ardent and inconsiderate
soldiers resolved to employ every means to interrupt
the negotiation, and whilst re-conducting the deputies to
the fortress, said to them: “<i>Defend yourselves, for if you
surrender to the Christians, you will all perish in tortures.</i>”
In addition to this, they addressed the Christian soldiers,
and informed them, with accents of anger and grief, that a
disgraceful peace was about to be concluded with the
enemies of Christ. At the same time, such of the leaders
as inclined towards peace, spread themselves through the
camp, and represented to the army that it was useless, and
perhaps dangerous, to purchase by new contests that which
fortune, or rather Providence itself, offered to the Crusaders.
Among the Christian warriors, some yielded to the counsels
of moderation, others were unwilling to trust to anything
but the sword; such as preferred victory to peace, ran to
arms, and they who accepted the capitulation, retired to
their tents. The camp, in which some remained in inaction
and repose, whilst others prepared for battle, presented, at
the same time, an image of peace and war: but in this
diversity of opinions, amidst so strange a spectacle as the army
then presented, it was easy to foresee that they would very
soon be unable either to treat with enemies or fight them.</p>

<p>The capitulation was, notwithstanding, ratified by the
principal chiefs and by the chancellor of the empire. The
hostages the Saracens were to send were looked for in the
camp, and the Crusaders fancied they could see the gates of
the castle of Thoron thrown open to them; but despair had
all at once changed the resolutions of the Saracens. When
the deputies to the Christian camp reported to their companions
in arms what they had seen and what they had
heard; when they told them of the menaces that had been
made to them, and of the divisions that existed among the
enemies, the besieged forgot that their walls were in ruins,
that they wanted both arms and provisions; that they had to
defend themselves against a victorious army; and they swore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
rather to die than treat with the Crusaders. Instead of
sending hostages, they appeared in arms upon the ramparts,
and provoked the besiegers to renew the contest. The
Christians resumed the labours of the siege, and recommenced
their attacks; but their courage grew weaker every
day, whilst, in the same proportion, despair seemed to increase
the bravery of the Mussulmans. The besieged
laboured without intermission in repairing their machines
and rebuilding their walls; sometimes the Christians were
attacked in the subterranean passages they had dug, and
perished, buried under masses of loosened earth; whilst
arrows and stones were constantly showered upon them
from the ramparts. Frequently the Saracens succeeded in
surprising some of their enemies, whom they carried alive
into the place, and then slaughtered without mercy; the
heads of these unfortunate prisoners were exposed upon the
walls, and afterwards hurled by the machines into the camp
of the Christians. The Crusaders appeared to have sunk
into a sort of dejection or apathy; some still fought and
remembered their oaths; but others remained indifferent
spectators of the dangers and death of their brethren.
Many added the scandal of the most depraved morals to
their indifference for the cause of God. There might be
seen, says an historian, men who had quitted their wives to
follow Christ, forgetting all at once the most sacred duties,
and attaching themselves to vile prostitutes; in fact, the vices
and disorders of the Crusaders were so disgraceful, that the
authors of the old chronicles blush whilst they retrace the
picture of them. Arnold of Lubec, after having described
the corruption that reigned in the camp of the Christians,
appears to ask pardon of his reader; and, that he may not
be accused of writing a satire, he takes care to add that he
does not recall such odious remembrances to confound the
pride of men, but to warn sinners, and touch, if possible,
the hearts of his brothers in Christ.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Fame soon brought to the ears of the Christians that the
kingdoms of Aleppo and Damascus were in arms, that Egypt
had assembled an army, and that Malek-Adel, followed by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
numberless multitude of warriors, was advancing by forced
marches, impatient to avenge his late defeat.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>At this news, the leaders of the crusade resolved to raise
the siege of Thoron; and to conceal their retreat from the
enemy, they did not blush to deceive their own soldiers. On
the day of the Purification of the Virgin, whilst the Christians
were engaged in the offices of devotion, the camp was
informed, by sound of trumpet, that it was intended to make
a general assault on the morrow. The whole army passed
the night in preparations for the fight; but, at break of
day, they learnt that Conrad and most of the leaders had
quitted the army and taken the road to Tyre. The men
assembled in groups round their tents to ascertain the truth,
and made inquiries of each other with the greatest inquietude.
The blackest forebodings took possession of the minds of the
Crusaders; as if they had been conquered in a great battle,
their only thought was flight. Nothing had been prepared
for the retreat, no order had been given; no man saw anything
but his own danger, or listened to any advice but that
suggested by his fear; some loaded themselves with everything
valuable they possessed, whilst others abandoned even
their arms. The sick and wounded dragged themselves
along with pain in the steps of their companions; such as
could not walk were abandoned in the camp. The confusion
was general; the soldiers marched <i>pêle-mêle</i> with the baggage;
they knew not what route to take, and many lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
themselves in the mountains; nothing was heard but cries
and groans, and, as if Heaven wished to denote its anger at
this disorder, a frightful tempest came on; fierce lightning
rent the clouds, the thunder rolled in awful peals, and
torrents of rain inundated the country.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> In their tumultuous
flight, not one of the Crusaders ventured to turn his
eyes to that fortress which, but a few days before, had offered
to surrender to their arms: their terror was not abated till
they beheld the walls of Tyre.</p>

<p>The army being at last re-assembled, it became a general
inquiry, “What was the cause of the disorder they had
experienced?” Then a new delirium took possession of the
Christians; mistrust and mutual hatred succeeded to the
panic terror of which they had been the victims; the most
grave suspicions were attached to actions the most simple,
and gave an odious meaning to words perfectly innocent. The
Crusaders reproached each other, as with wrongs and proofs
of treachery, with all the evils they had suffered or feared
to suffer. The measures that an improvident zeal had counselled,
as well as those that had been dictated by necessity
and prudence, were the work of perfidy without example.
The holy places, which so lately the Crusaders had contemplated
with apparent indifference, now occupied their every
thought; and the most fervent reproached the leaders with
introducing none but profane views into a holy war; with
having sacrificed the cause of God to their own ambition,
and with having abandoned the soldiers of Christ to the
fury of the Saracens. The same Crusaders proclaimed
loudly, that God had been unfavourable to the Christians,
because those whom he had appointed to lead the defenders
of the cross, disdained the conquest of Jerusalem. Our
readers may remember that after the siege of Damascus, in
the second crusade, some Templars and Germans were
accused of avarice, and of having sacrificed the zeal and
bravery of the Christian warriors. Accusations quite as
serious were renewed on this occasion, and with equal
bitterness. If we are to believe the old chronicles, Malek-Adel
had promised several leaders of the Christian army a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
great number of pieces of gold to engage them to raise the
siege of Thoron; and the same chronicles add, that when
the Mussulman prince paid them the sum agreed, he gave
them nothing but false gold,&mdash;a worthy price of their cupidity
and treachery.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> The Arabian historians give no sanction to
these odious accusations; but such was the spirit of animosity
which then reigned among the Christian warriors, that they
were judged with more severity by their brethren and companions
in arms than by their enemies.</p>

<p>At length the rage of discord was carried so far that the
Germans and the Syrian Christians would not remain under
the same colours; the former retired to the city of Jaffa, the
ramparts of which they restored, and the latter returned to
Ptolemaïs. Malek-Adel, willing to profit by these divisions,
marched towards Jaffa, and offered the Germans battle. A
severe conflict took place at a short distance from the city.
The duke of Saxony and the duke of Brabant both perished
in the <i>mêlée</i>.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> The Crusaders lost a great number of their
bravest warriors; but the victory was in their favour. After
a triumph which was due to their arms alone, the pride of
the Germans knew no bounds; and they treated the Christians
of Palestine with the greatest contempt. “We have,”
said they, “crossed the seas to defend their country; and, far
from taking any part in our labours, these warriors, without
either gratitude or courage, abandoned us in the hour of
peril.” The Christians of Palestine, on their side, reproached
the Germans with having come into the East, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
to fight but to command; not to assist their brethren, but
to impose a yoke upon them more insupportable than that
of the Saracens. “The Crusaders,” added they, “only
quitted the West to make a pleasurable military progress
into Syria; they there found peace, but they left war behind
them; like those birds of passage that announce the season
of storms and tempests.”</p>

<p>In these fatal divisions nobody had sufficient credit and
power to restrain angry spirits, or reconcile discordant
opinions. The sceptre of Jerusalem was in the hands of a
woman; the throne of Godfrey, so often shaken, was destitute
of support; the empire of religion and law was every
day fading away, and violence alone possessed the privilege
of making itself respected. Necessity and force were the
only powers that commanded obedience; whilst the license
and corruption that prevailed among the people, still called
<i>the people of God</i>, made such frightful progress, that we are
tempted to accuse contemporary authors and ocular witnesses
of employing great exaggeration in their recitals.</p>

<p>In this state of decline, amidst such shameful disorders,
the most wise and prudent of the prelates and barons
thought the best step they could adopt would be to give an
able and worthy leader to the Christian colonies, and they
entreated Isabella, the widow of Henry of Champagne, to take
a new husband, who might consent to be their sovereign.
Isabella, by three marriages, had already given Palestine
three kings. They proposed to her Amaury, who had
recently succeeded Guy de Lusignan in the kingdom of
Cyprus. An Arabian historian says that Amaury was <i>a wise
and prudent man, who loved God and respected humanity</i>.
He did not fear to reign, amidst war, troubles, and factions,
over the poor remains of the unfortunate kingdom of Jerusalem,
and came to share with Isabella the vain honours of
royalty. Their marriage was celebrated at Ptolemaïs, with
more pomp, say historians, than the posture of affairs
warranted. Although this marriage might not remedy all
the evils under which the Christians laboured, it at least
afforded them the consolatory hope that their discords would
be appeased, and that the colonies of the Franks, when
better governed, might gather some fruit from so many
victories gained over the infidels. But news which arrived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
from the West, soon spread fresh grief through the kingdom,
and put an end to the barren exploits of the holy war.
Amidst the festivities which followed the marriage and
coronation of Amaury, the death of the emperor Henry VI.
was announced.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> The election of a new head of the empire
would most probably produce a violent contest in Germany;
and every one of the German princes or nobles then in
Palestine, naturally turned his attention to that which he
had to hope or fear in the events preparing in Europe: they
determined to return immediately into the West.</p>

<p>The count de Montfort and several other French knights
had but recently arrived in the Holy Land, and earnestly
entreated the German princes to defer their return. The
pope likewise, on receiving intelligence of the death of
Henry VI., wrote to the leaders of the Crusaders, to implore
them to finish their good work, and not to abandon
the cause of Christ; but neither the prayers of the count
de Montfort nor the exhortations of the pope could detain
the Germans, impatient to return to their country. Of so
many princes who had left the West to secure a triumph to
the cause of God, the queen of Hungary alone was faithful
to her vows, and remained with her knights in Palestine.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
On quitting Syria, the Germans contented themselves with
leaving a garrison in Jaffa. A short time after their departure,
whilst celebrating the feast of St. Martin with every
excess of drunkenness and debauchery, this garrison was
surprised and massacred by the Saracens.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Winter was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
approaching; neither party could keep the field; discord
reigned equally among Christians and Mussulmans; and both
sides were desirous of peace, because they were incapable of
carrying on the war. The count de Montfort concluded
with the Saracens a truce for three years. Thus terminated
this crusade, which only lasted a few months, and was really
nothing but a pilgrimage for the warriors of the West. The
victories of the Crusaders rendered the Christians masters
of all the coasts of Syria; but their precipitate departure
destroyed the fruits of their conquests. The cities they had
obtained were left without defenders, and almost without
inhabitants.</p>

<p>This fourth crusade, in which all the powers of the West
miscarried in an attempt upon a little fortress of Syria, and
which presents us with the strange spectacle of a holy war
directed by an excommunicated monarch, furnishes the historian
with fewer great events and a smaller number of
great misfortunes than the preceding expeditions. The
Christian armies, which made but a transient visit to the
East, experienced neither the famine nor the diseases that
had proved so fatal to the former enterprises. The foresight
and attention of the emperor of Germany, who had become
master of Sicily, provided for all the wants of the Crusaders,
whose exploits were intended to assist his ambitious projects,
and whom he considered as his own soldiers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>The German warriors that composed the Christian armies
had not the requisite qualities to secure the advantages of
victory.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Always ready to throw themselves blindly into
danger; quite ignorant that it is possible to ally prudence
with courage; listening to nothing but the violence of their
own passions, and recognising no law but their own will;
obedient to leaders of their own nation, and despising all
others; full of an indomitable pride, which made them disdain
the help of their allies and the lessons of experience,
such men could neither make peace nor war.</p>

<p>When we compare these new Crusaders with the companions
of Richard or Godfrey, we find in them the same
ardour for fight, the same indifference for danger; but we
find them very deficient in that enthusiasm which animated
the first soldiers of the cross at the sight of the holy places.
Jerusalem, which had never ceased to be open to the devotion
of the faithful, no longer beheld within its walls that
crowd of pilgrims which, at the commencement of the holy
wars, repaired thither from all parts of the West. The pope
and the leaders of the Christian army forbade Crusaders to
enter the holy city without having conquered it; and they,
who did not always prove so docile, obeyed the prohibition
without pain. More than a hundred thousand warriors that
had left Europe for the purpose of delivering Jerusalem,
returned to their homes without having entertained perhaps
one thought of visiting the tomb of Christ, for which they
had taken up arms. The thirty ounces of gold promised by
the emperor to all who should cross the sea to fight the
infidels, very much increased the number of the Crusaders;
this was not the case in former expeditions, in which the
crowd of soldiers of the cross was influenced principally by
religious motives. More religion than politics had entered
into the other holy wars; in this crusade, although it had
been directly promoted by the head of the Church, and was
to a considerable extent directed by bishops, we may safely
say there was more of politics than religion. Pride, ambition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
jealousy, the most disgraceful passions of the human
heart, did not make an effort, as in the preceding expeditions,
to cover themselves with a religious veil. The archbishop
of Mayence, the bishop of Hildesheim, with most of
the other ecclesiastics who took the cross, attracted no admiration
for either their wisdom or piety, or distinguished
themselves by any personal quality. Conrad, the chancellor
of the empire, on his return to Europe, was followed by
the suspicions which had been attached to his conduct
during the holy war; and when, a long time after, he was
slain by several gentlemen of Wurtzburg, who conspired
against him, the people considered his tragical death as a
punishment from Heaven.</p>

<p>Henry VI., who had preached the crusade, only viewed
this distant expedition as a means and an opportunity for
increasing his power and extending his empire; whilst the
West put up prayers for the success of a holy war, of
which he was the life and soul, he prosecuted an impious
war, desolated a Christian people for the purpose of subjecting
them to his laws, and threatened the empire of Greece.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
The son of Tancred was deprived of his sight, and cast into
prison, and the daughters of the king of Sicily were carried
away into captivity. Henry’s barbarities were so excessive,
that he irritated his neighbours, and created enemies in his
own family. When he died, a report prevailed in Europe
that he had been poisoned; the nations that he had rendered
miserable could not believe that so many cruelties
could remain unpunished, and they asserted that Providence
had employed the wife of the emperor to be his
executioner, and to avenge all the calamities he had inflicted
upon the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily. At the approach
of death, Henry remembered that he had persecuted Richard;
that he had detained a prince of the Crusaders in chains,
in spite of the solicitations of the father of the faithful;
and he hastened to send ambassadors to the king of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
England, charged with the task of making him a solemn
reparation for so great an outrage. After his death, as he
had been excommunicated, it was thought necessary to
address the sovereign pontiff to obtain permission to bury
him in the Holy Land; and the pope coolly replied, that
they were at liberty to bury him among Christians, but before
they did so, they must offer up many prayers to mitigate the
anger of God.</p>

<p>In taking possession of the beautiful and rich territories
of Italy by perfidy and violence, Henry prepared for that
unfortunate country a series of revolutions, to be renewed
from age to age. The odious war he had made against the
family of Tancred, naturally gave birth to other wars
injurious to his own family.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> In removing so far from
Germany with his armies, Henry afforded opportunity for
the formation of powerful parties, which, at his death, disputed
the imperial sceptre with some success, and at length
gave rise to a war in which the principal states of Europe were
involved. Thus, whilst the other holy wars had contributed
to maintain or establish public peace in Europe, this fourth
crusade produced divisions among the states of Christendom,
without at all diminishing the power of the Saracens, and
only served to introduce trouble and confusion into many
kingdoms of the West.</p>

<p class="pc mid">FIFTH CRUSADE.</p>

<p class="pc lmid">A.D. 1198-1204.</p>

<p class="p2">“<i>Christian troops</i>,” says J. J. Rousseau, in his “Contrat
Social,” “<i>are, as they say, excellent; I deny it; show me
such; for my part, I know no Christian troops</i>.” The events
we have just related, and those we are about to make known,
will, there is no doubt, suffice to refute this strange paradox
of J. J. Rousseau. The author of the “Social Contract”
does not dissemble, it is true, the objections that may be
made to him from the history of the crusades; but, ever
faithful to his system, and taking no account of historical
truths, he answers, that “<i>the Crusaders, far from being Christians,
were citizens of the Church; that they fought for their
spiritual country, which the Church had rendered temporal
nobody knows how</i>.” Strange abuse of reasoning, which confounds
the sense of words, and refuses the title of Christians
to those who fought in the name of Christ! In representing
the Crusaders as citizens of the Church, Rousseau doubtless,
meant to say that the popes were the origin of the
crusades, and that the soldiers of the cross defended the
temporal power of the popes. We at once reply that the
crusades owed their birth and growth to the religious and
warlike enthusiasm that animated the nations of the West
in the twelfth century, and that without this enthusiasm,
which was not the work of the heads of the Church, the
preachings of the Holy See would not have been able to
collect a single army under the banners of the cross. We
may further add that, during the holy wars, the sovereign
pontiffs were frequently driven from Rome and despoiled of
their states, and that they did not summon the Crusaders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
to the defence of the power or <i>temporal country</i> of the
Church. Not only were the Crusaders not always the blind
instruments of the Holy See, but they sometimes resisted
the will of the popes, and yet in their camps were no less
models of valour united with Christian piety. No doubt,
the leaders were often seduced by ambition, the love of
glory, and a passion for war; but religion, well or ill understood,
acted upon the greater number; the Christian religion
which they defended, or believed they defended, by
inspiring them with a desire for the blessings of heaven and
a contempt for life, elevated them above all perils, and
enabled them to brave death on every occasion. Here is
the whole truth; but this truth is too simple for such as
disdain common routes, and cannot form a judgment upon
human affairs without displaying all the parade of a proud
and austere philosophy. For ourselves, who are persuaded
that true philosophy consists in studying the human
heart and the spirit of societies, not in vain theories, but in
the faithful history of past ages; we will not refute brilliant
sophisms by long arguments; but to show in all its
splendour the valour of <i>Christian soldiers</i>, we will content
ourselves with pursuing our recital, and making known with
impartiality the labours, the reverses, and the victories of
the soldiers of the cross.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>The departure of the German Crusaders plunged the
eastern Christians into grief and consternation; the colonies,
when left to their own resources, were only protected by
the truce concluded between the count de Montfort and
Malek-Adel. The infidels had too great a superiority over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
their enemies to respect, for any length of time, a treaty
which they considered as an obstacle to the progress of
their power. The Christians, threatened by new perils, again
turned their eyes to the West. The bishop of Ptolemaïs,
accompanied by several knights, embarked for Europe, in
order to solicit the aid of the faithful. The vessel in which
he embarked had scarcely quitted the port, when it was
swallowed up by the waves, and the bishop and every person
of his suite perished. Other ships, that set sail a short time
afterwards, were surprised by the tempest, and forced to
return to the port of Tripoli; so that the prayers and
complaints of the Christians of Palestine could not reach
the ears of their brethren of the West. Nevertheless, the
afflicting news of the situation of the feeble kingdom of
Jerusalem soon became generally known; some pilgrims,
escaping from the perils of the sea, described, on their
return, the triumphs and threats of the Saracens; but in
the state of Europe at that moment, nothing could be more
difficult than to induce nations to undertake a new crusade.
The death of the Emperor Henry VI. divided the princes
and prelates of Germany, and Philip Augustus was still at
war with Richard of England. One of the sons of Bela,
king of Hungary, who pretended to take the cross, only
assembled an army to agitate the kingdom, and get possession
of the crown. Amidst the fierce contentions that
disturbed Europe, the Christian people seemed to have
forgotten the tomb of Christ: a single man was touched
with the misfortunes of the faithful of the East, and was not
without hope of alleviating them.</p>

<p>Innocent III., at the age of thirty-three, had recently
gained the suffrages of the conclave.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> At a period of life
in which the passions are generally masters, devoted to the
most austere retirement, constantly occupied with the study
of holy books, and ready at all times to confound new heresies
by the force of reason, the successor of St. Peter shed
tears on being informed of his elevation; but when seated
on the pontifical throne, Innocent all at once exhibited a
new character: the same man, who had appeared to dread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the splendour of a lofty position, became most eager, by any
means, to increase his power, and displayed all the ambition
and inflexible obstinacy of Gregory VII. His youth, which
promised him a long reign; his ardour in the defence of justice
and truth; his eloquence, his knowledge, his virtues,
which drew upon him the respect of the faithful, all united
to give birth to the hope that he would assure the triumph
of religion; and that he would one day accomplish the projects
of his predecessors.</p>

<p>As the power of the pope was founded upon the progress
of the faith and the holy enthusiasm of the Christians,
Innocent gave his first attention to the suppression of the
dangerous innovations and imprudent doctrines that began
to corrupt his age and menace the sanctuary; he particularly
endeavoured to reanimate the ardour for the crusades:
and, to master the minds of kings and nations, to
rally all Christians, and make them concur in the triumph
of the Church, he spoke to them of the captivity of Jerusalem;
he pointed to the tomb of Christ, and the holy
places profaned by the presence and the domination of
infidels.</p>

<p>In a letter<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> addressed to the bishops, the clergy, the
nobles, and people of France, England, Hungary, and Sicily,
the sovereign pontiff made known the will, the menaces, and
the promises of God. “Since the lamentable loss of Jerusalem,”
said he, “the Holy See has never ceased to cry
towards Heaven, and to exhort the faithful to avenge the
injury done to Christ, thus banished from his heritage.
Formerly Uriah would not enter into his house, or see his
wife, whilst the ark of the Lord was in the camp; but now
our princes, in this public calamity, abandon themselves to
illegitimate amours; immerse themselves in voluptuousness;
abuse the blessings that God has given them; and pursue
each other with implacable hatred; only thinking of revenging
their own personal injuries, they never consider
that our enemies insult us, saying: ‘<i>Where is your God,
who cannot deliver himself out of our hands? We have profaned
your sanctuary, and the places in which you pretend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
your superstition had its birth; we have crushed the arms of
the French, the English, the Germans, and subdued a second
time the proud Spaniards: what remains then for us to do?
to drive out those you have left in Syria, and to penetrate into
the West to efface for ever both your name and your memory.</i>’”
Assuming then a more paternal tone: “Prove,” cried Innocent,
“that you have not lost your courage; be prodigal, in
the cause of God, of all you have received from him; if, on
an occasion so pressing, you refuse to serve Christ, what
excuse will you be able to offer at his terrible tribunal? If
God died for man, shall man fear to die for his God? Will
he refuse to give up his transitory life and the perishable
goods of this world for him who lays before us the treasures
of eternity?”</p>

<p>Prelates were at the same time sent through all the countries
of Europe, to preach peace among princes, and exhort
them to unite against the common enemies of God. These
prelates, clothed in the full confidence of the Holy See, were
to engage cities and nobles to equip, at their own expense,
for the Holy Land, a certain number of warriors, to serve
there during two years at least. They promised remission
of sins,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> and the special protection of the Church<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> to all
that would take up the cross and arms, or would contribute
to the equipment and support of the soldiers of Christ. To
receive the pious tribute of the faithful, boxes were placed
in all the churches. At the tribunal of penitence, the
priests were ordered to command all sinners to concur in
the holy enterprise; no error could find grace before God,
without the sincere will of participating in the crusade;
zeal for the deliverance of the holy places appeared to be at
that time the only virtue the pope required of Christians,
and even charity itself lost some of its value, if not exercised
in promoting the crusades. As the Church of Rome was
reproached with imposing upon the people <i>burdens to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
she only applied the tip of her own finger</i>, the pope exhorted
the heads of the clergy, and the clergy themselves, to set an
example of devotedness and sacrifices. Innocent ordered
his gold and silver plate to be melted to defray the expenses
of the holy war, and would allow none but vessels of wood
and clay to be seen on his table whilst the crusade lasted.</p>

<p>The sovereign pontiff was so satisfied of the zeal and
piety of the Christians, that he wrote to the patriarch and
king of Jerusalem, to announce to them the coming succours
from the West. He neglected nothing that could
augment the numbers of the soldiers of Christ; he addressed
himself to the emperor of Constantinople, and reproached
him with indifference for the deliverance of the holy places.
The emperor Alexius endeavoured, in his answer, to show
his zeal for the cause of religion; but he added that the
time of deliverance was not yet arrived, and that he feared to
oppose himself to the will of God, irritated by the sins of
the Christians. The Greek prince adroitly reminded him of
the ravages committed in the territories of the empire by
the soldiers of Frederick, and conjured the pope to direct
his reproofs against those who, feigning to labour for Jesus
Christ, acted against the will of Heaven. In his correspondence
with Alexius, Innocent III. did not at all conceal
his pretensions to universal empire, and spoke in the character
of sovereign arbiter of the kings of the East and
West. He applied to himself these words addressed to
Jeremiah: “I have placed thee over the nations and over
the kingdoms, to pull up and scatter, to edify and to plant.”
When speaking of the power of the popes and that of
princes, he compared the one to the sun, which lights the
universe during the day, and the other to the moon, which
lights the earth during the night.</p>

<p>The pretensions that Innocent put forth, and the haughtiness
with which he sought to establish them, were, no
doubt, injurious to the effect of his exhortations, and must
have weakened the zeal of the Christian princes whom he
wished to persuade to undertake the crusade. The princes
and bishops of Germany were divided between Otho of
Saxony and Philip of Swabia; the sovereign pontiff pronounced
strongly for Otho, and threatened with the thunders
of the Church all who assisted the opposite party. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the dissensions occasioned by this momentous affair, some
availed themselves of the opportunity to gain the favour of
the pope, and others to secure themselves from the effects of
his anger; but all Germany being engaged in the quarrel,
nobody took the cross.</p>

<p>One of the pope’s legates, Peter of Capua, succeeded in
re-establishing peace between Richard Cœur de Lion and
Philip Augustus. Richard, who was desirous of conciliating
the good-will of the Holy See, constantly promised to equip
a fleet and collect an army to go and make war against the
infidels. He proclaimed a tournament in his capital, in the
midst of which he called upon the barons and knights to
follow him into the East; but all these demonstrations, the
sincerity of which was very suspicious, remained unproductive.
It was not long before war again broke out between
France and England; and Richard, who on all occasions
repeated his vow of combating the infidels, was killed in a
petty quarrel with Christians.</p>

<p>Philip Augustus repudiated Ingeburge, daughter of the
king of Denmark, to marry Agnes de Meranie. The sovereign
pontiff, in a letter addressed to the faithful, strongly
censured princes who gave themselves up to illegitimate
amours; he ordered Philip Augustus to take back Ingeburge,
and as Philip refused to obey, the kingdom of France
was placed under an interdict. During several months all
religious ceremonies were suspended; the pulpits of the
Gospel ceased to give forth the holy word; church bells and
the voice of prayer were silenced; Christian burial was
refused to the dead; the sanctuary was closed against the
faithful; a long mourning veil seemed to hang over cities
and plains, from which the Christian religion was banished,
and which might almost be fancied to be invaded by the
Saracens. Although such as took the cross were exempt
from the interdict, the spectacle which France presented
discouraged and saddened its inhabitants. Philip Augustus,
irritated against the pope, showed very little disposition to
revive their zeal; and the clergy, whose influence might have
had a powerful effect, had less reason to deplore the captivity
of Jerusalem than the unhappy state of the kingdom.</p>

<p>At length a curé of Neuilly-sur-Maine began to fill France
with the fame of his eloquence and his miracles. Foulques<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
had at first led a very dissipated life, but, touched with sincere
repentance, he was not satisfied with expiating his
irregularities by penitence, but became desirous of bringing
back all sinners to the paths of salvation, and travelled
through the provinces endeavouring to awaken in the people
a contempt for the things of this life. God, to try him,
permitted that, in his early sermons, Foulques should be
exposed to the ridicule of his auditors; but the truths he
uttered soon obtained a marvellous ascendancy over all that
came to hear him. Bishops invited him to preach in their
dioceses; he received everywhere extraordinary honours, and
both people and clergy flocked out to meet him, as if he had
been an envoy of God. Foulques, says the chronicle of
St. Victor, had nothing remarkable in his vestments or manner
of living; <i>he travelled on horseback, and ate that which
was given to him</i>. He preached sometimes in churches, at
others in public places, and not unfrequently amidst the
excitement of tournaments. His eloquence was simple and
natural; safe, by his ignorance, from the bad taste of his
age, he neither astonished his auditors by the vain subtleties
of the schools, nor by an absurd mixture of passages from
the Scriptures and profane quotations from antiquity. His
words, from being unadorned by the erudition then so much
admired, were the more persuasive, and found their way more
directly to the heart.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> The most learned preachers ranked
themselves among his disciples, and declared that the Holy
Ghost spoke by his mouth. Animated by that faith which
performs prodigies, he enchained at his pleasure the passions
of the multitude, and caused to resound, even in the palaces
of princes, the <i>thunders of evangelical denunciations</i>.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> At his
voice, all that had enriched themselves by fraud, brigandage,
or usury, hastened to restore that which they had unjustly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
acquired; libertines confessed their sins, and devoted themselves
to the austerities of penitence;<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> prostitutes, following
the example of Madeline, deplored the scandal of their lives,
cut off their hair, exchanged their gaudy apparel for haircloth
and mean garments, and made vows to sleep upon
ashes and die in retirement. In short, the eloquence of
Foulques of Neuilly effected such miracles, that contemporaries
speak of him as of another St. Paul, sent for the conversion
of his age. One of them even goes so far as to say
that he dares not relate all he knows of him, fearing the incredulity
of men.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>Innocent III. cast his eyes upon Foulques of Neuilly, and
confided to him the mission that, fifty years before, had been
given to St. Bernard. The new preacher of the crusade
himself assumed the cross at a general chapter of the order
of Citeaux. At the sound of his voice, the zeal for the
holy war, which had appeared extinct, blazed out again in all
parts. In every city he passed through, the people crowded
to listen to him; and all who were in a condition to bear
arms, took the oath to combat the infidels.</p>

<p>Several holy orators were associated with Foulques of
Neuilly; Martin Litz, of the order of Citeaux, in the
diocese of Bâle, and on the banks of the Rhine; Herloin, a
monk of St. Denis, took his cause through the still wild
countries of Bretagne and the lower Poitou; and Eustace,
abbot of Flay, crossed the sea twice, to awaken the enthusiasm
and holy ardour of the provinces of England.</p>

<p>These pious orators were not all endowed with the same
eloquence; but all were animated by the most ardent zeal.
The profanation of the holy places, the evils suffered by the
Eastern Christians, and the remembrance of Jerusalem,
imparted the most lively interest to their discourses, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
touched all hearts.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Such was the spirit spread through
Europe, that simply to mention the name of Christ, or to
speak of the city of God, held in captivity by the infidels,
melted auditors to tears, and gave birth to transports of
enthusiasm. The people everywhere evinced the same piety
and the same feelings; but the cause of Christ still wanted
the example and courage of princes and nobles. As a celebrated
tournament had been proclaimed in Champagne, at
which the boldest warriors of France, Germany, and Flanders
were expected to be present, Foulques repaired to the
castle of Ecry-sur-Aisne,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> which was the rendezvous of the
knights. His eloquence procured attention to the complaints
of Sion, even amidst the profane and violent amusements of
chivalry; when Foulques spoke of Jerusalem, knights and
barons neglected their jousts, the shivering of lances, or
high feats of arms; they became insensible of the presence
of <i>dames</i> and <i>demoiselles</i>, who accorded the prizes to valour;
and turned a deaf ear to the gay minstrels who celebrated
<i>la prouesse achetée et vendue au fer et à l’acier</i>. All took
the oath to fight against the infidels; and it must have been
surprising to see numerous defenders of the cross come
forth from these warlike festivals that were so severely reprehended
by the Church.</p>

<p>Among the princes and lords who enrolled themselves in
the crusade, the most conspicuous were Thibault IV., count of
Champagne, and Louis, count of Chartres and Blois, both
relations of the kings of France and England. The father
of Thibault had followed Louis VII. to the second crusade,
and his elder brother had been king of Jerusalem. Two
thousand five hundred knights owed him homage and military
service, and the nobility of Champagne excelled in all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
noble exercises of arms.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> The marriage of Thibault with
the heiress of Navarre brought to his standard a great
number of warriors from the countries bordering on the
Pyrenees. Louis, count of Chartres and Blois, reckoned
among his ancestors one of the most illustrious chiefs of the
first crusade, and was master of a province abounding in
warriors of name. After the example of these two princes,
the following distinguished leaders took the cross:&mdash;The
count of St. Paul, the counts Gauthier and Jean de Brienne,
Manassès de l’Isle, Renard de Dampièrre, Mathieu de
Montmorency, Hugh and Robert de Boves, d’Amiens,
Renaud de Boulogne, Geoffrey de Perche, Renaud de Montmirail,
Simon de Montfort, who had just signed a treaty
with the Saracens, but was no less ready on that account to
take an oath to fight against them; and Geoffrey de Villehardouin,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
marshal of Champagne, who has left us an account
of this crusade in the unadorned language of his time.</p>

<p>Among the ecclesiastics, history names Nivelon de Chérisi,
bishop of Soissons; Garnier, bishop of Langres; the
abbot of Looz, and the abbot of Veaux-de-Cernai. The
bishop of Langres, who had been the object of the censures
of the pope, expected to find in the pilgrimage to the Holy
Land, an opportunity of reconciling himself with the Holy
See. The abbot of Looz and the abbot of Veaux-de-Cernai
were both remarkable for their piety and learning; the former
full of wisdom and moderation, the latter animated by a holy
enthusiasm and an ardent zeal, which afterwards he but too
strongly displayed against the Albigeois and the partisans of
the count of Thoulouse.</p>

<p>When the knights and barons returned to their homes,
bearing a red cross upon their baldrics and their coats of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
mail,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> they aroused by their presence the enthusiasm of
their vassals and brothers in arms. The nobility of Flanders,
after the example of those of Champagne, were anxious to
prove their zeal for the recovery of the holy places. Baldwin,
who had taken the part of Richard against Philip Augustus,
sought beneath the standard of the cross an asylum against
the anger of the king of France, and swore, in the church of
St. Donatien of Bruges, to go into Asia to combat the
Saracens. Mary, countess of Flanders, sister of Thibault,
count of Champagne, would not live separated from her
husband; and although she was still in the flower of her
youth, and was several months advanced in her pregnancy,
took an oath to follow the Crusaders beyond the seas, and to
quit a home she was doomed never to see again. The
example of Baldwin was followed by his two brothers,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
Eustace and Henry, count of Sarbuck; by Canon de Bethune,
whose piety and eloquence were held in high estimation, and
by Jacques d’Avesnes, son of him who, under the same name,
had made himself so famous in the third crusade. Most of
the knights and barons of Flanders and Hainault also took
the oath to share the labours and perils of the holy war.</p>

<p>The principal leaders first met at Soissons, and afterwards
at Compiègne. In their assembly, they gave the command
of the expedition to Thibault, count of Champagne. It was
decided also that the Crusaders should repair to the East by
sea; and, in consequence of this determination, six deputies
were sent to Venice,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> in order to obtain from the republic
the vessels required to transport the men and horses.</p>

<p>The Venetians were at that period in the highest state of
their greatness and prosperity. Amidst the convulsions that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
had preceded and followed the fall of the Roman power, these
industrious people had taken refuge in the islands that
border the extremity of the Adriatic Gulf; and, placed upon
the waves, had directed all their views to the empire of the
sea,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> of which the barbarians took no heed. Venice was at
first under the dominion of the emperors of Constantinople;
but, in proportion with the decline of the Greek empire, the
republic acquired territory, strength, and splendour, which
necessarily produced independence. From the tenth century,
palaces of marble had replaced the humble huts of fishermen,
scattered over the island of the Rialto. The cities of Istria
and Dalmatia obeyed the sovereigns of the Adriatic Sea.
The republic, become formidable to the most powerful
monarch, was able, at the least signal, to arm a fleet of a
hundred galleys, which it employed successively against the
Greeks, the Saracens, and the Normans. The power of
Venice was respected by all the nations of the West; and
the republics of Genoa and Pisa in vain contended with her
for the domination of the seas. The Venetians remembered
with pride these words of Pope Alexander III., when the
republic had protested against the emperor of Germany,
who presented a ring to the doge, saying, “<i>Espouse the sea
with this ring, that posterity may know that the Venetians
have acquired the empire of the waves, and that the sea has
been subjected to them as a woman is to her husband</i>.”</p>

<p>The fleets of the Venetians constantly visited the ports of
Greece and Asia; they transported pilgrims to Palestine,
and returned laden with the rich merchandise of the East.
The Venetians entered into the crusades with less eagerness
and enthusiasm than other Christian nations, but knew well
how to profit by them for their own interests; whilst the
warriors of Christendom were fighting for glory, for kingdoms,
or for the tomb of Christ, the merchants of Venice
fought for counting-houses, stores, and commercial privileges;
and avarice often made them undertake that which
other nations could not have been able to effect but by an
excess of religious zeal. The republic, which owed all its
prosperity to its commercial relations, sought without scruple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the friendship and protection of the Mussulman powers of
Syria and Egypt; and often, even when all Europe was
arming against the infidels, the Venetians were accused of
supplying the enemies of the Christian nations with both
arms and provisions.</p>

<p>When the deputies of the Crusaders arrived at Venice, the
republic had for doge Dandolo, so celebrated in its annals.
Dandolo had for a length of time served his country in
important missions, and in the command of its fleets and
armies; now, placed at the head of its government, he watched
over its liberties and the operations of its laws. His
labours in war and peace, his useful regulations of the money
currency, with his administration of justice and public
security, deservedly procured him the esteem and gratitude
of his fellow-citizens. He had acquired the power of mastering,
by words, the passions of the multitude, even in the
stormy disputes of a republic.</p>

<p>Nobody was more skilful in seizing a favourable opportunity,
or in taking advantage of the least circumstance for the
furtherance of his designs. At the age of ninety, the doge
of Venice exhibited no symptoms of senility but virtue and
experience.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Everything that could save his country aroused
his activity and inflamed his courage; with the spirit of
calculation and economy which distinguished his compatriots,
Dandolo mingled passions the most generous, and threw an
air of grandeur over all the enterprises of a trading people.
His patriotism, always sustained by the love of glory, appeared
to possess something of that sentiment of honour, and
that chivalric greatness of soul which formed the predominant
characteristic of his age.</p>

<p>Dandolo<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> praised with warmth an enterprise that appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
glorious to him, and in which the interests of his country
were not opposed to those of religion. The deputies required
vessels to transport four thousand five hundred
knights and twenty thousand foot, with provisions for the
Christian army for nine months. Dandolo promised, in the
name of the republic, to furnish the necessary provisions and
vessels, on condition that the Crusaders should engage to
pay the Venetians the sum of eighty-five thousand silver
marks.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> As he was not willing that the people of Venice
should be unconnected with the expedition of the French
Crusaders, Dandolo proposed to the deputies to arm, at the
expense of the republic, fifty galleys, and demanded for his
country half of the conquests that might be made in the
East.</p>

<p>The deputies accepted without hesitation the more interested
than generous proposals of the doge. The conditions
of the treaty were first examined in the doge’s council,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
composed of six patricians; it was afterwards ratified in
two other councils,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> and at last presented for the sanction
of the people, who then exercised supreme power.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>A general assembly was convoked in the church of St.
Mark, and when the mass of the Holy Ghost had been celebrated,
the marshal of Champagne, accompanied by the other
deputies, arose, and addressing the people of Venice, pronounced
a discourse, the simple and unaffected expressions
of which paint, better than we possibly can, the spirit and
feelings of the heroic periods of our history.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> “The lords<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
and barons of France, the most high and the most powerful,
have sent us to you to pray you, in the name of God, to
take pity on Jerusalem, which the Turks hold in bondage;
they cry to you for mercy, and supplicate you to accompany
them to avenge the disgrace of Jesus Christ. They have
made choice of you, because they know that no people that
be upon the sea have so great power as your nation. They
have commanded us to throw ourselves at your feet, and not
to rise until you shall have granted our request, until you
shall have had pity on the Holy Land beyond the seas.” At
these words the deputies were moved to tears,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> and feeling
it no degradation to humble themselves in the cause of
Christ,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> they fell upon their knees and held up their hands
in a supplicating manner towards the assembly of the people.
The strong emotion of the barons and knights communicated
itself to the Venetians, and ten thousand voices replied as
one, “<i>We grant your request</i>.” The doge, ascending the
tribunal, praised highly the earnestness and loyalty of the
French barons, and spoke with enthusiasm of the honour
God conferred upon the people of Venice in choosing them
from amongst all other nations,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> to partake in the glory of
the most noble of enterprises, and associate them with the
most valiant of warriors. He then read the treaty entered
into with the Crusaders, and conjured his assembled fellow-citizens
to give their consent to it in the forms ordained by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the laws of the republic. Then the people arose, and cried
with an unanimous shout, “<i>We consent to it</i>.” All the inhabitants
of Venice were present at this meeting; an immense
multitude covered the place of St. Mark and filled the
neighbouring streets. Religious enthusiasm, love of country,
surprise and joy were manifested by acclamations so
loud and general, that it might be said, according to the expression
of the marshal of Champagne, “<i>that the world was
about to engage in one common conflict</i>.”</p>

<p>On the morrow of this memorable day, the deputies of the
barons repaired to the palace of St. Mark, and swore on
their swords and the Gospel, to fulfil all the engagements
they had made. The preamble of the treaty recalled the
faults and the misfortunes of the princes who had to that
time undertaken the deliverance of the Holy Land, and
praised the wisdom and prudence of the French lords and
knights, who neglected nothing to assure the success of an
enterprise full of difficulties and perils. The deputies were
charged to endeavour to cause the conditions they had
sworn to to be adopted by their brothers in arms the barons
and knights, by <i>the whole of their nation</i>, and <i>if possible, by
their sovereign lord the king of France</i>. The treaty was
written on parchment and sent immediately to Rome, to
receive the approbation of the pope; and, full of confidence
in the future, as well as in the alliance they had contracted,
the French knights and the patricians of Venice exchanged
the most touching protestations of friendship.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> The doge
lent the barons the sum of ten thousand silver marks, and
the latter swore never to forget the services the republic
had rendered to Jesus Christ. “There were then shed,”
says Villehardouin, “many tears of tenderness and joy.”</p>

<p>The government of Venice was a new spectacle for the
French nobles; deliberations of the people were perfectly
unknown to them, and must have struck them with astonishment.
On the other side, the embassy of the knights
and barons could not fail to flatter the pride of the Venetians;
the latter felicitated themselves upon being thus acknowledged
as the greatest maritime nation, and, never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
separating their glory from their commercial interests, rejoiced
at having made so advantageous a bargain. The
knights, on the contrary, only thought of honour and the
cause of Christ; and although the treaty was ruinous to the
Crusaders, they bore back the news to their companions in
arms with the greatest joy and satisfaction.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>The preference given to the Venetians by the Crusaders
naturally excited the jealousy of the other maritime powers
of Italy; thus the French deputies, upon going to Pisa and
Genoa to solicit the aid of the two republics in the name of
Jesus Christ, met with a cold reception and a perfect indifference
for the deliverance of the holy places.</p>

<p>The account of what had taken place at Venice, and the
presence of the barons, did not fail, however, to arouse the
enthusiasm of the inhabitants of Lombardy and Piedmont;
a great number of them took the cross and arms, and promised
to follow Boniface, marquis of Montferrat, to the Holy
Land.</p>

<p>The marshal of Champagne, whilst crossing Mount Cenis,
met Gauthier de Brienne, who had taken the cross at the
castle of Ecry, and was on his way to Apulia. He had married
one of the daughters of Tancred, last king of Sicily.
Followed by sixty knights of Champagne, he was going to
endeavour to make good the claims of his wife, and conquer
the kingdom founded by the Norman knights. The marshal
Villehardouin and Gauthier de Brienne congratulated each
other upon the brilliant prospects of their expeditions, and
promised to meet again in the plains of Egypt and Syria.
Thus the future presented nothing to the knights of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
cross but victories and trophies; and the hope of conquering
distant kingdoms redoubled their ardour.</p>

<p>When the deputies arrived in Champagne, they found
Thibault dangerously ill. The prince was so delighted at
learning the success of their embassy, that, heedless of the
disease that had confined him to his bed, he insisted upon
putting on his armour and mounting on horseback; but “this
was great pity and misfortune,” says Villehardouin; “for the
malady increased, and gathered such strength, that he declared
his will, took leave of his friends, and got no more on horseback.”
Thibault, the model and hope of the Christian knights,
died in the flower of his age, deeply regretted by his vassals
and companions in arms. He deplored before the barons
the rigorous destiny that condemned him thus to die without
glory, at the moment that he was about to gather the palms
of victory or of martyrdom in the plains of the East; he
exhorted them to perform the vow he had made to God to
deliver Jerusalem, and left them all his treasures to be employed
in this holy enterprise. An epitaph in Latin verse,
which still exists, celebrates the virtues and pious zeal of
Count Thibault, recalls the preparations for his pilgrimage,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
and terminates by saying, that this young prince <i>found the
heavenly Jerusalem, when about to seek the earthly Jerusalem</i>.</p>

<p>After the death of the count of Champagne, the barons
and knights who had taken the cross, assembled to choose
another leader, and their election fell upon the count de Bar
and the duke of Burgundy. The count de Bar refused to
take the command of the Christian army. Eudes III., duke
of Burgundy, still mourned the death of his father, who had
died in Palestine after the third crusade, and could not be
induced to quit his duchy to undertake the pilgrimage to the
East. The refusal of these two princes was a subject of
scandal for the soldiers of the cross; and contemporary history
informs us that they afterwards repented of the indifference
they had evinced for the cause of Christ.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> The duke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
of Burgundy, who died within a few years, was desirous of
taking the cross on his bed of death, and, to expiate his
fault, sent several of his warriors into Palestine.</p>

<p>The knights and barons then offered the command to
Boniface, marquis of Montferrat.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Boniface belonged to a
family of Christian heroes; his brother Conrad had rendered
himself famous by the defence of Tyre, and he himself had
already fought many times against the infidels: he did not
hesitate in complying with the wishes of the Crusaders. He
came to Soissons, where he received the cross from the
hands of the curé of Neuilly, and was proclaimed leader of
the crusade in the church of Notre Dame, in the presence
of the clergy and the people.</p>

<p>Two years had passed away since the sovereign pontiff
had ordered the bishops to preach the crusade in their
dioceses. The situation of the Christians of the East became
every day more deplorable; the kings of Jerusalem
and Armenia, the patriarchs of Antioch and the holy city,
and the grand masters of the military orders, addressed day
after day their complaints and lamentations to the Holy See.
Touched by their prayers, Innocent again exhorted the faithful,
and conjured the Crusaders to hasten their departure;
warmly censuring the indifference of those who, after having
taken the cross, appeared to be forgetful of their vow. The
Christian father, above all, reproached the ecclesiastics with
their tardiness in paying the fortieth part of their revenues,
destined to the expenses of the holy war: “and you and we,”
said he, “and all persons supported by the goods of the
Church, ought we not all to fear that the inhabitants of
Nineveh should appear against us at the day of judgment,
and pronounce our condemnation? for they were made penitent
by the preaching of Jonas; and you, not only you have
not rent your hearts, you have not even opened your hands
to succour Christ in his poverty, and repulse the opprobrium
with which the infidels load him.” The epoch of a holy war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
being for Christians a season of penitence, the sovereign
pontiff proscribed, in his letters, sumptuousness in living,
splendour in dress, and public amusements; and although
the new crusade had been first preached at the tournament
of Ecry, tournaments were in the number of diversions and
spectacles forbidden to all Christians by the holy father
during the space of five years.</p>

<p>To reanimate the courage and confidence of those who
had taken the cross, Innocent told them of the new divisions
that had sprung up among the Mussulman princes, and of
the scourges with which God had recently afflicted Egypt.
“God,” cried the pontiff, “has struck the country of Babylon
with the rod of his power; the Nile,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> that river of Paradise,
which fertilizes the land of the Egyptians, has not had its
accustomed course. This chastisement has given them up
to death, and prepared the triumph of their enemies.” The
letters of the pope had the desired effect. The marquis of
Montferrat went into France, towards the autumn of the
year 1201, and the whole winter was devoted to preparations
for the holy war. These preparations were unaccompanied
by disorder, and the princes and barons refused to receive
under their banners any but disciplined soldiers and men
accustomed to the use of the lance and the sword. Some
voices were raised against the Jews, whom they desired to
force to contribute to the expenses of the holy war;<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> but the
pope took them under his protection, and threatened all who
made attempts upon their lives or liberty with excommunication.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>Before they left their homes, the Crusaders had to deplore
the loss of the holy orator who had awakened their zeal and
animated their courage. Foulques fell sick, and died in his
parish of Neuilly. Some time before, loud murmurs had
been heard respecting his conduct, and his words had ceased
to exercise their accustomed power over the minds of his
auditors. Foulques had received considerable sums of money
destined for the expenses of the holy war, and as he was
accused of appropriating these to his own use, the more
money he amassed, says James of Vitri,<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> the more consideration
and credit he lost. The suspicions attached to
his conduct were not, however, generally credited. The
marshal of Champagne informs us, in his history, that the
knights and barons were deeply affected by the death of the
curé of Neuilly. Foulques was buried in the church of his
parish with great pomp; his tomb, a monument of the piety
of his contemporaries, attracted, even in the last century
the respect and veneration of the faithful.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>With the earliest days of spring the Crusaders prepared
to quit their homes, “and knew,” says Villehardouin, “that
many tears were shed at their parting, and at taking leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
of their relations and friends.” The count of Flanders, the
counts of Blois and St. Paul, followed by a great number of
Flemish warriors and their vassals; the marshal of Champagne,
accompanied by several Champenois knights, advanced
across Burgundy, and passed the Alps to repair to
Venice. The Marquis Boniface soon joined them, bringing
with him the Crusaders of Lombardy, Piedmont, Savoy, and
the countries situated between the Alps and the Rhone.
Venice also received within its walls the warriors from the
banks of the Rhine, some under the command of the bishop
of Halberstadt, and others under that of Martin-Litz, who
had persuaded them to take arms, and still continued to
animate them by the example of his virtues and piety.</p>

<p>When the Crusaders reached Venice,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> the fleet that was
to transport them into Asia, was ready to set sail: they were
at first received with every demonstration of joy; but amidst
the festivities that followed their arrival,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> the Venetians
called upon the barons to redeem their word, and pay the
sum agreed upon for transporting the Christian army; and
then it was that, with deep grief, the barons became aware
of the absence of a great number of their companions in
arms. Jean de Nesle, châtelain of Bruges, and Thierri, son
of Philip, count of Flanders, had promised Baldwin to bring
to him, at Venice, Marguerite, his wife, and a chosen band
of Flemish warriors: they did not keep their appointment,
for having embarked upon the ocean, they had directed their
course to Palestine. Renaud de Dampierre, to whom Thibault,
count of Champagne, had left all his treasures to be
employed in the voyage to the Holy Land, had embarked with
a great number of Champenois knights at the port of Bari.
The bishop of Autun, Gilles, count of Ferez, and several
other leaders, after having sworn upon the Gospel to join
the other Crusaders, had set out from Marseilles, and others
from Genoa. Thus half the Crusaders did not come to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Venice, which had been agreed upon as the general rendezvous
of the Christian army: “by which,” says Villehardouin,
“they received great shame, and many misadventures afterwards
befell them in consequence of it.”</p>

<p>This breach of faith might prove very injurious to the
enterprise; but what most grieved the princes and barons
assembled at Venice, was the impossibility of fulfilling their
engagements with the republic without the concurrence of
their unfaithful companions. They sent messengers into all
parts to warn the Crusaders that had set out, and to implore
them to join the main army; but whether most of the pilgrims
were dissatisfied with the agreement entered into with
the Venetians, or whether it appeared to them more convenient
and safe to embark at ports in their own vicinity, a
very small number of them could be prevailed upon to repair
to Venice. Those who were already in that city, were neither
sufficiently numerous nor sufficiently rich to pay the promised
amount, or fulfil the engagements made in their names.
Although the Venetians were more interested in the crusade
than the French knights, as they possessed a part of the cities
of Tyre and Ptolemaïs, which they were going to defend, they
were unwilling to make any sacrifice, and the barons, on
their side, were too proud to ask any favour, or to solicit the
Venetians to change or moderate the conditions of the
treaty. Each of the Crusaders was required to pay the
price of his passage. The rich paid for the poor; soldiers
as well as knights being eager to give all the money they
possessed, persuaded, they said, that God was powerful
enough to return it to them a hundred-fold, when it should
please him. The count of Flanders, the counts of Blois
and St. Paul, the marquis of Montferrat, and several other
leaders despoiled themselves of their plate, their jewels, and
everything they had that was most valuable,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> and only retained
their horses and arms. Notwithstanding this noble
sacrifice, the Crusaders still were indebted to the republic a
sum of fifty thousand silver marks. The doge then assembled
the people, and represented to them that it was not honourable
to employ too much rigour, and proposed to demand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
of the Crusaders the assistance of their army for the republic,
until they could discharge their debt.</p>

<p>The city of Zara had been for a length of time under the
dominion of the Venetians; but thinking the government of
a king less insupportable than that of a republic, it had
given itself up to the king of Hungary, and, under the protection
of a new master, braved the authority and menaces
of Venice. After having obtained the approbation of the
people, Dandolo proposed to the Crusaders to assist the republic
in subduing a revolted city, and promised to put off
the entire execution of the treaty until God, by their
common conquests, should have given them the means of
fulfilling their promises. This proposition was received with
much joy by the greater part of the Crusaders, who could
not support the idea of being unable to keep their word; the
barons and knights deemed it prudent to conciliate the Venetians,
who were so serviceable to them in carrying out their
enterprise, and thought they did but little to pay their debts
by an affair in which they should expend nothing but their
blood.</p>

<p>Some murmurs, however, arose in the Christian army;
many of the Crusaders recollected the oath they had taken
to fight the infidels, and could not make up their minds to
turn their arms against a Christian people. The pope had
sent the Cardinal Peter of Capua to Venice, to deter the
pilgrims from an enterprise which he termed sacrilegious.
“The king of Hungary had taken the cross, and by doing so
had placed himself under the especial protection of the
Church; and to attack a city belonging to him was to declare
themselves enemies of the Church itself.” Henry Dandolo
braved menaces and reproaches that he deemed to be unjust.
“The privileges of the Crusaders,” said he, “could not
screen the guilty from the severity of laws divine and human.
Crusades were not undertaken to promote the ambition of
kings or protect rebellious nations.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> The pope had not the
power to enchain the authority of sovereigns, or turn the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Crusaders aside from a legitimate enterprise; from a war
made against revolted subjects, against pirates whose brigandage
perilled the freedom of the seas, and jeopardized the
safety of pilgrims on their way to the Holy Land.”</p>

<p>To complete his conquest over all scruples, and dissipate
all fears, the doge resolved to associate himself with the
perils and labours of the crusade, and to engage his fellow-citizens
to declare themselves the companions in arms of the
Crusaders. The people being solemnly convoked, Dandolo
ascended the pulpit of St. Mark, and demanded of the assembled
Venetians permission to take the cross. “Seigneurs,”
said he to them, “you have made an engagement to concur
in the most glorious of enterprises; the warriors with whom
you have contracted a holy alliance, surpass all other men in
piety and valour. For myself, you see that I am laden with
years, and have need of repose; but the glory that is promised
to us restores me courage and strength to brave all the
perils, to support all the labours of war. I feel by the
ardour that leads me on, by the zeal which animates me, that
nobody will merit your confidence, nobody will conduct you
so well as the man you have chosen as head of your republic.
If you will permit me to fight for Jesus Christ, and allow my
son to perform the duties you have confided to me, I will go
and live or die with you and the pilgrims.”</p>

<p>At this discourse, his whole auditory was much affected,
and the people loudly applauded the resolution of the doge.
Dandolo descended from the tribunal, and was led in triumph
to the foot of the altar, where the cross was attached to his
ducal cap. A great number of Venetians followed his
example, and swore to die for the deliverance of the holy
places. By this skilful policy, the doge completely won the
Crusaders, and placed himself, in a manner, at the head of
the crusade. He soon found himself sufficiently powerful to
deny the authority of the cardinal of Capua, who spoke in
the name of the pope, and pretended to have a right to direct
the holy war, in his character of legate of the Holy See.
Dandolo told the envoy of Innocent, that the Christian army
stood in no need of leaders to conduct it, and that the legates
of the sovereign pontiff ought to content themselves with
edifying the Crusaders by their examples and discourses.</p>

<p>This bold, free language very much astonished the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
barons, accustomed to respect the will of the Holy See; but
the doge, by taking the cross, had inspired them with a confidence
nothing could shake. The cross of the pilgrims was,
for the Venetians and French, a pledge of alliance, a sacred
tie, which united all their interests, and made of them, in a
manner, but one same nation. From that time no one
listened to those who spoke in the name of the Holy See,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
or persisted in raising scruples in the minds of the Crusaders.
The barons and knights showed the same zeal and
ardour for the expedition against Zara as the Venetians
themselves. The army of the Crusaders was ready to
embark, when there happened, says Villehardouin, “a great
wonder, an unhoped-for circumstance, the strangest that ever
was heard of.”<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>Isaac, emperor of Constantinople, had been dethroned by
his brother Alexius. Abandoned by all his friends, deprived
of sight, and loaded with irons, this unhappy prince languished
in a dungeon. The son of Isaac, named also Alexius,
who shared the captivity of his father, having deceived the
vigilance of his guards and broken his chains, had fled into
the West, in the hope that the princes and kings would one
day undertake his defence, and declare war against the
usurper of the imperial throne. Philip of Swabia, who had
married Irene, the daughter of Isaac,<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> received the young
prince kindly; but he was not then in a position to undertake
anything in his favour, being fully engaged in defending
himself against the arms of Otho and the menaces of the
Holy See. Young Alexius next in vain threw himself at the
feet of the pope, to implore his assistance. Whether the
pontiff saw in the son of Isaac only the brother-in-law of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Philip of Swabia, then considered an enemy to the court of
Rome, or whether all his attention was directed towards the
East, he gave no ear to the complaints of Alexius, and seemed
to dread countenancing a war against Greece. The fugitive
prince had in vain solicited most of the Christian monarchs,
when he was advised to address himself to the Crusaders, the
noblest warriors of the West. The arrival of his ambassadors
created a lively sensation at Venice; the knights and barons
were impressed with generous pity by the account of his
misfortunes; they had never defended a more glorious cause.
To avenge injured innocence, to remedy a great calamity,
stirred the spirit of Dandolo; and the proud republicans,
whose head he was, feelingly deplored the fate of a fugitive
emperor. They had not forgotten that the usurper preferred
to an alliance with them one with the Genoese and Pisans;
it appeared to them that the cause of Alexius was their own,
and that their vessels ought to bear him back to the ports of
Greece and Byzantium.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as everything was prepared for the conquest
of Zara, the decision of this business was deferred to a more
favourable opportunity; and the fleet, with the Crusaders on
board, set sail amidst the sounds of martial music and the
acclamation of the whole population of Venice. Never had
a fleet so numerous or so magnificently equipped been seen
in the Adriatic Gulf. The sea was covered with four
hundred and eighty ships; the number of the combatants,
horse and foot, amounted to forty thousand men. After
having subdued Trieste and some other maritime cities of
Istria that had shaken off the yoke of Venice, the Crusaders
arrived before Zara on the 10th day of November, 1202, the
eve of St. Martin. Zara,<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> situated on the eastern side of the
Adriatic Gulf, sixty leagues from Venice, and five leagues
north of Jadera, an ancient Roman colony, was a rich and
populous city, fortified by high walls, and surrounded by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
sea studded with rocks. The king of Hungary had sent
troops to defend it, and the inhabitants had sworn to bury
themselves beneath the ruins of the place rather than
surrender to the Venetians. At the sight of the ramparts of
the city, the Crusaders perceived all the difficulty of the
enterprise, and the party opposed to this war again ventured
to murmur. The leaders, however, gave the signal for the
assault. As soon as the chains of the port were broken, and
the machines began to make the walls shake, the inhabitants
forgot the resolution they had formed of dying in defence of
their ramparts, and, filled with dread, sent deputies to the
doge, who promised to pardon them on account of their
repentance. But the deputies charged with the petition for
peace, met with several Crusaders among the besiegers, who
said to them, “Why did you surrender? you have nothing
to fear from the French?” These imprudent words rekindled
the war; the deputies, on their return, announced to the
inhabitants that all the Crusaders were not their enemies,
and that Zara would preserve its liberty if the people and
soldiers were willing to defend it. The party of the malcontents,
whose object was to divide the army, seized this
opportunity for reviving their complaints; the most ardent
amongst them, insinuating themselves into the tents of the
soldiers, and endeavouring to disgust them with a war which
they termed impious.</p>

<p>Guy, abbot of Vaux de Cernai, of the order of Citeaux,
made himself conspicuous by his endeavours to secure the
failure of the enterprise against Zara; everything that could
divert the march of the Crusaders from the route to the holy
places,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> was, in his eyes, an attack upon religion. The most
brilliant exploits, if not performed in the cause of Christ,
could command neither his esteem nor his approbation. The
abbot of Cernai was deficient in neither subtlety nor eloquence,
and knew how to employ both prayers and menaces
effectively; he had that influence over the pilgrims that an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
inflexible mind and an ardent, obstinate character always
obtains over the multitude. In a council, he arose, and
forbade the Crusaders to draw their swords against Christians,
and was about to read a letter from the pope, when he
was interrupted by threats and cries.</p>

<p>Amidst the tumult which followed in the council and the
army, the abbot of Cernai would have been in danger of his
life, if the count de Montfort, who partook his sentiments,
had not drawn his sword in his defence. The barons and
knights could not, however, forget the promise they had
made to fight for the republic of Venice; nor could they
think of laying down their arms in presence of an enemy
that had promised to surrender, and who now defied their
attacks. The greater the efforts of the count de Montfort
and the abbot of Cernai to interrupt the war, the more they
conceived their honour and glory to be engaged to continue
the siege they had begun. Whilst the malcontents were
giving vent to their scruples and complaints, the bravest of
the army proceeded to the assault. The besieged, whose
hopes were built upon the divisions among their enemies,
placed crosses upon the walls, persuaded that this revered
sign would protect them more effectually than their machines
of war; but they were not long in finding that there was no
safety for them except in submission. On the 5th day of the
siege, without having offered their enemies any serious
resistance, they opened their gates, and only obtained from
the conqueror liberty and life. The city was given up to
pillage, and the booty divided between the Venetians and
the French.</p>

<p>One of the results of this conquest was a fresh quarrel in
the victorious army, in which more blood flowed than had
been shed during the siege. The season being too far
advanced to allow the fleet to put to sea, the doge proposed
to the Crusaders to winter at Zara. The two nations occupied
different quarters of the city; but as the Venetians
had chosen the handsomest and most commodious houses,
the French loudly proclaimed their dissatisfaction. After a
few complaints and many threats, they had recourse to
arms, and every street became the theatre of a conflict; the
inhabitants of Zara beheld with delight the sanguinary disputes
of their conquerors. The partisans of the abbot of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Cernai applauded in secret the deplorable consequences of
a war they had condemned; whilst the doge of Venice and
the barons employed every effort to separate the combatants.
Their prayers and threats at first had no effect in
appeasing this horrible tumult, which was prolonged to the
middle of the night. On the morrow, all the passions that
divided the army were near breaking out with increased
fury. Whilst interring their dead, the French and Venetians
renewed their disputes and menaces. The leaders
were, for more than a week, in despair of being able to
calm the irritated spirits of their followers, and reunite the
soldiers of the two nations. Scarcely was order re-established
when a letter was received from the pope, who
disapproved of the capture of Zara, ordered the Crusaders
to renounce the booty they had made in a Christian city,
and to engage themselves, by a solemn vow, to repair the
injuries they had inflicted. Innocent reproached the Venetians
bitterly with having seduced the soldiers of Christ
into this impious and sacrilegious war. This letter from
the pope was received with respect by the French, with
disdain by the Crusaders of Venice. The latter openly
refused to bow to the decisions of the Holy See; and to
secure the fruits of their victory, began to demolish the
ramparts of Zara. The French barons could not endure the
idea of having incurred the anger of the pope, and sent
deputies to Rome to endeavour to mitigate the displeasure
of his holiness, and solicit their pardon, alleging that they
had only obeyed the law of necessity. The greater part of
them, though fully determined to retain all they had obtained,
promised the pope to restore their spoils: they
undertook, by a solemn act, addressed to all Christians, to
repair the wrongs they had done, and to merit by their
conduct pardon for past errors.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Their submission, far
more than their promises, disarmed the anger of the pope,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
who replied to them with mildness, and commanded the
leaders to salute the knights and pilgrims, giving them
absolution and his benediction, as to his children. He
exhorted them, in his letter, to set out for Syria, <i>without
turning to the right or the left</i>; and permitting them to
cross the sea with the Venetians, whom he had just excommunicated,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
<i>but only from necessity, and with bitterness of
heart</i>. If the Venetians persisted in their disobedience, the
sovereign pontiff advised the barons, when they arrived in
Palestine, to separate themselves from a people reproved of
God, for fear of bringing a malediction upon the Christian
army, as formerly Achan had brought down the divine
wrath upon the Israelites. Innocent promised the Crusaders
to protect them in their expedition, and to watch
over their wants during the perils of the holy war. “In
order that you may not want provisions,” said he to them,
“we will write to the emperor of Constantinople to furnish
you with them, as he has promised; if that be refused to
you which is refused to none, it will not be unjust, if,
after the example of many holy persons, you take provisions
wherever you may find them; for it will be known that you
are devoted to the cause of Christ, to whom all the world
belongs.”<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> These counsels and these promises, which so
completely reveal to us the spirit of the thirteenth century
and the policy of the Holy See, were received by the knights
and barons as evidence of the paternal goodness of the
sovereign pontiff: but the face of things was about again to
change; and fortune, which sported with the decisions of
the pope as well as those of the pilgrims, was not long in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
giving an entirely new direction to the events of the
crusade.</p>

<p>Ambassadors from Philip of Swabia, brother-in-law of
young Alexius, arrived at Zara, and addressed the council
of the lords and barons, assembled in the palace of the doge
of Venice. “Seigneurs,” said they, “the puissant king of
the Romans sends us to recommend to you the young
prince Alexius, and to place him in your hands, under the
safeguard of God. We do not come for the purpose of
turning you aside from your holy enterprise, but to offer
you an easy and a certain means of accomplishing your
noble designs. We know that you have only taken up
arms for the love of Christ and of justice; we come, therefore,
to propose to you to assist those who are oppressed by
unjust tyranny, and to secure at once the triumph of the
laws of religion and humanity: we propose to you to turn
your victorious arms towards the capital of Greece, which
groans under the rod of an usurper, and to assure yourselves
for ever of the conquest of Jerusalem by that of Constantinople.
You know, as well as we do, how many evils, our
fathers, the companions of Godfrey, Conrad, and Louis the
Young, suffered from having left behind them a powerful
empire, the conquest and submission of which would have
become a source of victories to their arms. What have you
not now to dread from this Alexius, more cruel and more
perfidious than his predecessors, who has gained a throne by
parricide, who has, at once, betrayed the laws of religion and
nature, and whose only means of escaping from the punishment
due to his crime is by allying himself with the Saracens?
We will not tell you how easy a matter it would be
to wrest the empire from the hands of a tyrant hated by his
subjects, for your valour loves obstacles and delights in
dangers; nor will we spread before your eyes the riches of
Byzantium and Greece, for your generous souls aim at
nothing in this conquest, but the glory of your arms and
the cause of Jesus Christ.”</p>

<p>“If you overturn the power of the usurper in order that
the legitimate sovereign may reign, the son of Isaac promises,
under the faith of oaths the most inviolable, to maintain,
during a year, both your fleet and your army, and to
pay you two hundred thousand silver marks towards the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
expenses of the war. He will accompany you in person in
the conquest of Syria or Egypt; and if you think proper,
will furnish ten thousand men, as his portion of the armament;
and, moreover, will maintain, during the whole of his
life, five hundred knights in the Holy Land. But that
which must weigh above all other considerations, with
warriors and Christian heroes, is that Alexius is willing to
swear, on the holy Gospel, to put an end to the heresy
which now defiles the empire of the East, and to subject the
Greek Church to the Church of Rome. So many advantages
being attached to the enterprise proposed to you, we feel
confident you will listen to our prayers. We see in Holy
Writ that God sometimes employed men the most simple
and the most obscure to make known his will to his chosen
people; on this occasion, it is a young prince he has appointed
the instrument of his designs; it is Alexius that
Providence has commissioned to lead you in the way of the
Lord, and to point out to you the road you must follow
to render certain the triumph of the armies of Jesus
Christ.”</p>

<p>This discourse made a strong impression upon a great
number of the knights and barons, but it did not command
the suffrages of the whole assembly. The doge and the
lords dismissed the ambassadors, telling them they would
deliberate upon the proposals of Alexius. Warm debates
then ensued in the council; those that had been averse to
the siege of Zara, among whom the abbot of Vaux de Cernai
was still conspicuous, opposed the expedition to Constantinople
with great vehemence; they were indignant that the
interests of God should be placed in the balance against
those of Alexius; they added that this Isaac, whose cause
they were called upon to defend, was himself an usurper,
elevated by a revolution to the throne of the Comnenas;
that he had been, during the third crusade, the most cruel
enemy of the Christians, the most faithful ally of the Turks;
as for the rest, the nations of Greece, accustomed to the
change of masters, supported the usurpation of Alexius
without murmuring, and the Latins had not quitted their
homes to avenge the injuries of a people that really did not
call upon them for aid.</p>

<p>The same orators further said, that Philip of Swabia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
exhorted the Crusaders to assist Alexius, but was content
himself with making speeches and sending ambassadors;
they warned the Christians not to trust to the promises of a
young prince, who engaged to furnish armies, and had not a
single soldier; who offered treasures, and possessed nothing;
who, besides, had been brought up amongst the Greeks, and
would, most likely, some day turn his arms against his
benefactors. “If you are so sensible to misfortune,” added
they, “and impatient to defend the cause of justice and
humanity, listen to the groans of our brethren in Palestine,
who are menaced by the Saracens, and who have no earthly
hope but in your courage.” They moreover told the Crusaders,
that if they wished for easy victories and brilliant
conquests, they had but to turn their eyes towards Egypt,
the population of which was at that moment devoured by a
horrible famine, and which the seven plagues of Scripture
yielded up to the arms of the Christians almost without
defence.</p>

<p>The Venetians, who had cause of complaint against the
emperor of Constantinople, were not at all affected by these
arguments, and appeared much more inclined to make war
upon the Greeks than the infidels; they were anxious to
destroy the warehouses of their rivals the Pisans, now established
in Greece, and to see their ships crossing the straits
of the Bosphorus in triumph. Their doge nourished a keen
resentment on account of some personal offence; and to
inflame the minds of his compatriots, he magnified all the
wrongs inflicted by the Greeks on his own country and the
Christians of the West.</p>

<p>If ancient chronicles may be believed, Dandolo was impelled
by another motive, which he did not avow before
the Crusaders. The sultan of Damascus, made aware of a
Christian army being assembled at Venice, and terrified at
the crusade that was preparing, had sent a considerable
treasure to the republic, to engage it to divert the Crusaders
from an expedition into the East. Whether we yield faith
to this account, or whether we consider it as a fable invented
by hatred and party spirit, such assertions, collected by
contemporaries, at least prove that violent suspicions were
then entertained against the Venetians by the dissatisfied
Crusaders, and particularly by the Christians of Syria, justly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
irritated at not being assisted by the soldiers of the cross.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
Nevertheless, we feel bound to add that the majority of the
French Crusaders stood in no need of being stimulated by
the example or speeches of the doge, to undertake a war
against the Greek empire. Even those who opposed the
new expedition the most strongly, as well as all the other
Crusaders, entertained an inveterate hatred and a sovereign
contempt for the Greeks; and the discussions had only the
more inflamed the general mind against a nation considered
inimical to the Christians.</p>

<p>Several ecclesiastics, having at their head the abbot of
Looz, a personage remarkable for his piety and the purity
of his manners, did not accord in opinion with the abbot of
Vaux de Cernai, and maintained that there was much danger
in leading an army into a country devastated by famine;
that Greece presented much greater advantages to the Crusaders
than Egypt, and that there could be no doubt that
the conquest of Constantinople was the most certain means
of securing to the Christians the possession of Jerusalem.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
These ecclesiastics were particularly fascinated by the hope
of one day seeing the Greek Church united to that of Rome,
and they constantly announced in their discourses the approaching
period of concord and peace among all Christian
people.</p>

<p>Many knights contemplated with satisfaction the prospect
of the union of the two churches, likely to be brought about
by their arms; but they yielded further to motives not less
powerful over their minds; they had sworn to defend innocence
and the rights of the oppressed, and they believed
they performed their duty in embracing the cause of Alexius.
Some of them, without doubt, who had heard of the vast
wealth of Byzantium, might believe that they should not
return from such a brilliant undertaking empty handed; but
such was the spirit of the lords and knights, that by far the
greater number were attracted by the mere prospect of the
perils, and still more by the wonders of the enterprise.
After a long deliberation, it was decided in the council
of the Crusaders that the proposals of Alexius should be
accepted, and that the Christian army should embark for
Constantinople at the commencement of spring.</p>

<p>Before the siege of Zara, the report of the armament of
the Crusaders, and of an expedition against Greece had
reached the court of Byzantium. The usurper of the
throne of Isaac immediately sought for means to avert the
storm about to fall upon his states, and hastened to send
ambassadors to the pope, whom he considered the arbiter of
peace and war in the West. These ambassadors were
ordered to declare to the sovereign pontiff that the prince
who reigned at Constantinople was the only legitimate
emperor; that the son of Isaac had no right to the empire;
that an expedition against Greece would be an unjust enterprise,
dangerous, and adverse to the great designs of the
crusade. The pope, in his reply, did not at all seek to calm
the fears of the usurper, but told his envoys that young
Alexius had numerous partisans among the Crusaders,
because he had made a promise to succour the Holy Land
in person, and to put an end to the rebellion of the Greek
Church. The pope did not approve of the expedition
against Constantinople; but, by speaking in the way he did,
he thought that the sovereign who then reigned over Greece<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
might be induced to make the same promises as the fugitive
prince, and would be more able to fulfil them; he conceived
a hope that they might treat advantageously, without having
recourse to the sword, and that the debates concerning the
empire of the East would be referred to his supreme tribunal.
But the elder Alexius, whether he was persuaded that
he had sufficiently interested the pope in his cause, or whether
he deemed it most prudent not to appear alarmed, or,
in short, whether the prospect of a distant danger could not
remove his habitual indolence, sent no more ambassadors,
and made not the least exertion to prepare against the invasion
of the warriors of the West.</p>

<p>In another direction, the king of Jerusalem and the
Christians of Palestine never ceased to give vent to their
complaints, and to implore the assistance that the head of
the Church had promised them. The pope, much affected
by their prayers, and always zealous for the crusade he had
preached, renewed his efforts to direct the arms of the Crusaders
against the Saracens. He sent the cardinals, Peter
of Capua, and Siffred, into Palestine, as legates of the Holy
See, to revive the courage of the Christians, and announce
to them the approaching departure of the army of Crusaders;
but when he learnt that the leaders had determined
upon attacking the empire of Constantinople, he poured
upon them the most bitter reprimands, and reproached them
with <i>looking behind them</i>, as Lot’s wife had done. “Let
none among you,” said he, “flatter himself that he may be
allowed to invade or plunder the lands of the Greeks, under
the pretence that the empire is not sufficiently submissive,
or that the emperor has usurped the throne of his brother;
whatever crime he may have committed, it is not for you to
constitute yourself the judge of it: you did not assume the
cross to avenge the injuries of princes, but that of God.”</p>

<p>Innocent finished his letter without bestowing his benediction
upon the Crusaders; and, to frighten them from
their new enterprise, threatened them with the maledictions
of Heaven. The barons and knights received the remonstrances
of the sovereign pontiff with respect; but did not
at all waver in the resolution they had formed.</p>

<p>Then the opponents of the expedition to Constantinople
renewed their complaints, and employed no sort of moderation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
in their discourses. The abbot of Vaux de Cernai, the
abbot Martin Litz, one of the preachers of the crusade, the
count de Montfort, and a great number of knights employed
every effort to shake the determination of the army; and
when they found they could not succeed, resolved to leave
them, some to return to their homes, and others to take the
route to Palestine. Those who abandoned their colours, and
those who remained in the camp, mutually accused each
other with betraying the cause of Christ.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Five hundred
soldiers having thrown themselves on board a vessel, were
shipwrecked and all swallowed up by the waves; many
others, in crossing Illyria, were massacred by the savage inhabitants
of that country. These perished cursing the ambition
and errors which had turned the Christian army aside
from the true object of the crusade; whilst those who
remained faithful to their standards, deplored the tragical
death of their companions, saying among themselves: “<i>The
mercy of the Lord has remained with us; evil be to them who
stray from the way of the Lord.</i>”</p>

<p>The knights and barons regretted in secret that they had
not been able to obtain the approbation of the pope, but
were persuaded that, by means of victories, they should justify
their conduct in the eyes of the Holy See; and that the
father of the faithful would recognise in their conquests
the expression of the will of Heaven.</p>

<p>The Crusaders were upon the point of embarking, when
young Alexius himself arrived at Zara. His presence
created a fresh enthusiasm for his cause; he was received
amidst the sounds of trumpets and clarions, and presented
to the army by the marquis of Montferrat,<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> whose elder
brothers had been connected by marriage and the dignity of
Cæsar, with the imperial family of Constantinople. The
barons hailed young Alexius as emperor, with the greater
joy, that they hoped his future grandeur would be the work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
of their hands. Alexius took arms to break the chains of
his father, and they admired in him a most touching model
of Christian piety: he was about to combat usurpation, to
punish injustice, and stifle heresy, and they looked upon him
as an envoy of Providence. The misfortunes of princes
destined to reign affect us more sensibly than those of other
men; in the camp of the Crusaders, the soldiers talked over
the story of Alexius among themselves, and they pitied his
youth, and deplored his exile and the captivity of Isaac.
Alexius, accompanied by the princes and barons, went constantly
among the soldiery, and replied by demonstrations
of the warmest gratitude to the generous interest the Crusaders
evinced in his favour.</p>

<p>Animated by sentiments which misfortune inspires, and
which not unfrequently terminate with it, the young prince
was lavish of vows and protestations, and promised even
more than he had done by his envoys, without thinking that
he placed himself under the necessity of failing in his word,
and drawing upon himself, one day, the reproaches of his
liberators.</p>

<p>The Crusaders, however, renewed every day their vow to
place young Alexius on the throne of Constantinople; and
Italy and the whole West rung with the fame of their preparations.
The emperor of Byzantium appeared to be the
only person ignorant of the war declared against his usurped
power, and slept upon a throne ready to crumble from under
him.</p>

<p>The emperor Alexius, like the greater part of his predecessors,
was a prince without virtues or character; when he
deposed his brother, he allowed the crime to be committed
by his courtiers, and when he was upon the throne he abandoned
to them the charge of his authority. He was lavish
of the treasures of the state, to secure pardon and oblivion
for his usurpation; and, to repair his finances, he sold justice,
ruined his subjects, and plundered the merchant ships
that traded between Ramisa and Constantinople. The
usurper scattered dignities and honours with such profusion,
that no one thought himself honoured by them, and there remained
in his hands no true reward for merit. Alexius had
associated his wife Euphrosyne with himself in the sovereign
authority, and she filled the empire with her intrigues, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
scandalized the court by the laxity of her morals. Under
his reign the empire had been several times menaced by the
Bulgarians and the Turks; Alexius occasionally visited the
army, but he never faced the enemy. Whilst the Bulgarians
were ravaging his frontiers, he employed himself in
levelling hills, and tracing gardens on the shores of the
Propontis. Abandoned to a shameful effeminacy, he disbanded
a part of his army; and fearing to be disturbed in
his pleasures by the din of arms, he sold the sacred vases,
and plundered the tombs of the Greek emperors, to purchase
peace of the emperor of Germany, who had become master
of Sicily. The empire had no navy left; the ministers had
sold the rigging and equipments of the vessels, and the
woods that might have furnished timber for new ships, were
reserved for the pleasures of the prince, and guarded as
strictly, says Nicetas, as those formerly consecrated to the
gods.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>Such numbers of conspiracies never were heard of; under
n, prince who was rarely visible, the government appeared to
be in a state of interregnum; the imperial throne was as an
empty seat, which every ambitious man aspired to occupy.
Devotedness, probity, bravery, were no longer held in esteem
by courtiers or citizens. Nothing was deemed worthy of
public approbation or reward but the invention of a new
pleasure or the fabrication of a fresh impost. Amidst this
general depravity, the provinces knew nothing of the emperor
but by the exaction of taxes;<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> and the army, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
discipline and without pay, had no leaders capable of commanding
it. Everything announced an approaching revolution
in the empire; and the peril was the greater from no
one having the courage to foresee it. The subjects of Alexius
never dreamt of obtruding truth upon the imperial ear;
birds, taught to repeat satires, alone interrupted the silence
of the people, and published from the roofs of houses, and
in the high streets, the scandals of the court and the disgrace
of the empire.</p>

<p>The Greeks, at the same time superstitious and corrupt,
still preserved some remembrances of ancient Greece and
old Rome; but these remembrances, instead of creating a
noble, emulative pride, only nourished in their hearts a puerile
vanity, and their history, of which they were so vain, only
served to render more striking their own degradation and
their empire’s too evident decay. The voice of patriotism
was never heard, and no influence was obeyed but that of
the monks placed at the head of affairs of all kinds, who
attracted and preserved the confidence of both people and
prince by frivolous predictions and senseless visions. The
Greeks wasted their time in vain disputes, which enervated
their character, increased their ignorance, and stifled their
patriotism. At the moment the fleet of the Crusaders was
about to set sail, Constantinople was in a state of ferment
with discussing the question whether the body of Jesus
Christ, in the Eucharist, is corruptible or incorruptible;
each opinion had its partisans, whose defeats or triumphs
were, by turns, loudly proclaimed&mdash;and the threatened empire
remained without defenders.</p>

<p>The Venetians and French left Zara, and the isle of Corfu
was appointed as the place of meeting for the whole fleet.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
When they landed on the shores of Macedon, the inhabitants
of Duras brought young Alexius the keys of the city, and
acknowledged him as their master. The people of Corfu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
were not tardy in following this example, and received the
Crusaders as liberators: the acclamations of the Greek
people, in the passage of the Latins, was a happy augury
for the success of their expedition.</p>

<p>The island of Corfu, the country of the Phœnicians, so
celebrated by the shipwreck of Ulysses and by the gardens
of Alcinoüs, afforded the Crusaders pasturage and abundance
of provisions. The fertility of the island induced the leaders
to remain there several weeks; but so long a repose did not
fail to produce evil consequences in an army supported by
enthusiasm, to which no time for reflection should have been
allowed, and, amidst indulgence and idleness, the complaints
and murmurs of the siege of Zara broke out again.</p>

<p>They learnt that Gauthier de Brienne had conquered
Apulia and the kingdom of Naples. This conquest,
effected in a few months, by sixty knights, inflamed the
imagination of the Crusaders, and furnished the malcontents
with a fresh opportunity for blaming the expedition to
Constantinople, the preparations for which were immense,
the perils evident, and the success uncertain. “Whilst we
are going,” said they, “to exhaust the resources of the West
in a useless enterprise, in a distant war, Gauthier de Brienne
has made himself master of a rich kingdom, and is preparing
to fulfil the promises he has entered into with us to deliver
the Holy Land; why should we not demand vessels of him?
why should we not set out for Palestine with him?” These
speeches prevailed over a great number of the knights, who
were ready to separate themselves from the army.</p>

<p>The chief malcontents had already assembled in a secluded
valley to deliberate upon the means of executing their project,
when the leaders of the army were warned of their
plot, and immediately united all their efforts to prevent the
fatal consequences of it. The doge of Venice, the count of
Flanders, the counts of Blois and St. Paul, the marquis of
Montferrat, and several bishops clothed in mourning habits,
with crosses borne before them, repaired to the valley in
which the malcontents were met. As soon as they, from a
distance, perceived their unfaithful companions, who were
deliberating on horseback, they alighted, and advanced towards
the place of assembly in a suppliant manner. The
instigators of the desertion, seeing the leaders and prelates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
of the army coming thus towards them, suspended their
deliberations, and themselves dismounted from their horses.
The parties approached each other; the princes, counts, and
bishops threw themselves at the feet of the malcontents,
and, bursting into tears, swore to remain thus prostrated till
the warriors who wished to abandon them, had renewed the
oath to follow the army of the Christians, and to remain
faithful to the standard of the holy war. “When the others
saw,” says Villehardouin, an ocular witness, “when they saw
their liege lords, their dearest relations and friends thus
cast themselves at their feet, and, so to say, cry to them for
mercy, they were moved with great pity, and their hearts
were so softened, they could not refrain from weeping, and
they told them that they would consider of it together
(<i>Qi’ils s’en aviseraient par ensemble</i>).” After having retired
for a moment to deliberate, they came back to their leaders,
and promised to remain with the army until the beginning
of autumn, on condition that the barons and lords would
swear upon the Gospel to furnish them at that period with
vessels to convey them to Syria. The two parties engaged
themselves by oath to perform the conditions of the treaty,
and returned together to the camp, where nothing now was
spoken of but the expedition to Constantinople.</p>

<p>The fleet of the Crusaders quitted the island of Corfu
under the most happy auspices; the historians who have
described its progress through that archipelago, so full of
remembrances of antiquity, have not been able to refrain
from employing the language of poetry. The wind was
favourable, and the sky pure and serene; a profound calm
reigned over the waves; three hundred vessels of all sizes,
with their colours floating from their sterns, covered an immense
space; the helmets and cuirasses of thirty thousand
warriors reflected the rays of the sun; now were heard
sounding over the waters the hymns of the priests, invoking
the blessings of Heaven; and then the voices of the soldiers,
soothing the leisure of the voyage with warlike songs; and
the braying of trumpets and neighing of horses, mingled
with the dashing of oars, resounded from the coasts of the
Peloponnesus, which presented themselves to the eyes of the
pilgrims. The Crusaders doubled Cape Matapan, known
formerly as Tenara, and passed before the heights of Malea,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
without dread of the rocks so much feared by ancient navigators.
Near Cape Malea they met two vessels returning
from Palestine, in which were many Flemish pilgrims. At
sight of the Venetian fleet, a soldier on board one of the
two ships, slipped down a rope, and bade adieu to his companions,
saying: “<i>I leave you all I have on board, for I am
going with people who intend to conquer kingdoms.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>The Crusaders landed at several islands they fell in with
on their passage; the inhabitants of Andros and Negropont
came out to meet Alexius, and acknowledged him as
their emperor. It was the period of harvest, and the land
presented, everywhere, a spectacle of the richest abundance.
The enjoyment of a beautiful climate, the satisfaction at the
submission of the Greeks, so many riches, so many wonders,
so many unknown regions, all daily increased the enthusiasm
of the Crusaders. At length the fleet arrived at the entrance
of the Bosphorus, and cast anchor in the port of St. Stephen,
three leagues from the capital of the Greek empire.</p>

<p>Then the city of Constantinople, of which they were
about to effect the conquest, broke full upon the view of
the Crusaders;<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> bathed on the south by the waves of the
Propontis, on the east by the Bosphorus, and on the north
by the gulf that serves as its port, it presented a spectacle
at once magnificent and formidable. A double enclosure of
walls surrounded it in a circumference of more than seven
leagues; a vast number of splendid buildings, whose roofs
towered above the ramparts, appeared to proclaim the queen
of cities. The shores of the Bosphorus to the Euxine and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
to the Hellespont, resembled an immense faubourg, or one
continued line of gardens. The cities of Chalcedon and
Scutari, built on the Asiatic shore, and Galata, placed at
the extremity of the gulf, appeared in the distance, and
crowned the immense and magnificent picture which lay
before the warlike hosts of the Crusaders.</p>

<p>Constantinople, situated between Europe and Asia, between
the Archipelago and the Black Sea, joins together the
two seas and the two continents. In the times of its splendour,
it held at its pleasure the gates of commerce open or shut;
its port, which received the vessels of all the nations of the
world, deserved to be termed by the Greeks, <i>the golden horn</i>,
or <i>the horn of abundance</i>. Like ancient Rome, Constantinople
extended over seven ascents, and, like the city of Romulus,
it sometimes bore the name of the city of the seven hills;
in the times of the crusades, its walls and its towers were
compared to those of Babylon; its deep ditches were converted
at will into a large and rapid lake, and the city could,
at the least signal, be surrounded by waters, and separated
from the continent.</p>

<p>The monarch who founded it reigned over all the known
nations of the world, and in the execution of his designs he
had the advantage of making the arts and sciences of Greece
concur with the genius and power of the Romans. Not
content with employing the beautiful marbles of the isles of
the Archipelago, he caused materials to be transported from
the extremities of Europe and Asia; all the cities of the
Roman empire, Athens, and Rome itself, were spoiled of
their ornaments to embellish the new city of the Cæsars.
Several of the successors of Constantine had repaired the
edifices that were crumbling into ruins, and had erected
fresh monuments in Constantinople, which in its temples,
upon its public places, and around the walls, everywhere recalled
the memory of twenty glorious reigns. The city was
divided into fourteen quarters; it had thirty-two gates; it
contained within its bosom circuses of immense extent, five
hundred churches, among which St. Sophia claimed attention
as one of the wonders of the world; and five palaces,
which themselves looked like cities in the midst of the great
city. More fortunate than its rival Rome, the city of Constantine
had never beheld the barbarians within its walls; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
preserved with its language the depository of the masterpieces
of antiquity, and the accumulated riches of the East
and the West.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to paint the enthusiasm, the fear, the
surprise that took possession of the minds of the Crusaders
at the aspect of Constantinople.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> The leaders landed, and
passed one night in the abbey of St. Stephen. This night
was employed in anxious deliberation upon what they had to
do; at one time they resolved to land upon the isles; then
they determined to make a descent upon the continent. In
the very same instant they drew back in terror and gave
themselves up to a wild joy; they could not come to any
fixed determination, but changed their plans and their projects
a thousand times. At daybreak Dandolo, Boniface,
Baldwin, and the count de Blois ordered all the standards
of the army to be unfurled; the escutcheons and coats of
arms of the counts and knights were ranged along the vessels,<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
to display the military pomp of the West and recall to
the warriors the valour of their ancestors. The signal was
given to the fleet, which entered into the canal, and, driven
on by a favourable wind, passed close to the walls of Constantinople.
An immense population,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> who only the day
before were ignorant of the arrival of the Latins, crowded
the ramparts and covered the shore. The warriors of the
West, clad in complete armour,<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> stood erect upon the decks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
of their vessels;<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> some stones and arrows were launched from
the towers and fell upon the ships: “there was no heart,”
says Villehardouin, “so bold as not to be moved; for never
was so great an affair undertaken.” Every warrior turned his
eye towards his sword, thinking the time was come in which
to make use of it. The Crusaders fancied that in the crowd of
spectators they beheld the defenders of Constantinople; but
the capital of the empire was only defended by the memory
of its past glory, and by the respect of the nations ignorant
of its weakness. Of true soldiers the imperial army only
mustered two thousand Pisans, who despised the Greeks,
and the troop of Varangians, mercenary soldiers from the
northern parts of Europe, with whose origin and country the
Greeks themselves were scarcely acquainted.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>The Crusaders made a descent upon the Asiatic shore of
the Bosphorus, pillaged the city of Chalcedon, and established
themselves in the palace and gardens in which the
emperor Alexius had so long forgotten his own dangers and
those of his empire. At the approach of the Venetian fleet,
this prince had retreated to Constantinople, where, like the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>last king of Babylon, he continued to live amidst pleasures
and festivities, without reflecting that he had been judged,
and that his hour was nearly come. His courtiers, in the
intoxication of the banquet, celebrated his power and proclaimed
him invincible; amidst the pomp that surrounded
him, and which appeared to him a rampart against the
attacks of his enemies, he, in his speeches, insulted the simplicity
of the Latins, and believed he had conquered them
because he had called them barbarians.</p>

<p>When he saw the Crusaders masters of his palace and gardens,
he began to entertain some degree of fear, and sent an
Italian named Rossi, with orders to salute the lords and
barons. “The emperor my master,” said the envoy of
Alexius, “knows that you are the most puissant and most
noble princes among those who do not wear crowns; but he
is astonished that you should have come to bring war into a
Christian empire. Rumour proclaims that your design is to
deliver the Holy Land from the yoke of the Saracens; the
emperor applauds your zeal, and solicits the honour of being
associated with your enterprise; he is ready to assist you
with all his power. But if you do not quit his states, he
shall feel obliged to direct against you the forces he would
willingly have employed in your cause and in that of Christ.
Accept, then, the generous offers that he makes to you by
me; but do not believe that this pacific language is dictated
by fear. The emperor Alexius reigns over Greece by the
love of his people as well as by the will of God; with one
single word he could gather around him innumerable armies,
disperse your fleet and your battalions, and close against
you for ever the routes to the East.”</p>

<p>The envoy of the emperor thus terminated his speech
without naming either Isaac or young Alexius. Conon de
Béthune,<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> who answered for the leaders of the army, was
astonished that the brother of Isaac should dare to speak as
master of the empire, and that he had not thought fit to
attempt to justify a parricide which had roused the indignation
of all Christian nations. “Go and tell your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
master,” said the orator of the Crusaders, addressing the
emperor’s envoy, “go and tell him, that the earth we tread
upon does not belong to him, but that it is the heritage of
the prince you see seated amongst us. If he be desirous of
knowing the motive that brings us hither, let him ask his
own conscience, and remember the crimes he has committed.
A usurper is the enemy of all princes; a tyrant is the enemy
of the whole human race. He who sent you has but one
means of escaping the justice of Heaven and of men; that
is, to restore to his brother and his nephew the throne he
has wrested from them, and implore the pity of those same
princes towards whom he has been so merciless. In that
case we promise to add our prayers to his supplications, and
to procure for him, with his pardon, the means of passing
his life in a repose far preferable to the splendour of an
usurped sovereignty; but if he is not willing to act justly, if
he is inaccessible to repentance, tell him we disdain his
threats as we do his promises, and that we have no time to
waste in listening to ambassadors.” This vehement reply
was an actual declaration of war, and left the emperor no
hope of either seducing or intimidating the Crusaders. The
lords and barons were, however, astonished that the Greeks
took no notice of young Alexius, and that the cause they
came to promote found no partisans in the city of Constantinople.
They resolved to ascertain the inclinations of the
people. A galley, on board of which was the son of Isaac,
was brought close to the walls of the capital;<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> Boniface and
Dandolo held up the young prince, whilst a herald-at-arms
repeated in a loud voice these words:&mdash;“<i>Behold the heir of
the throne; acknowledge your sovereign; have pity on him and
on yourselves.</i>” The Greeks assembled in the ramparts
remained motionless; some answered by insulting language,
others maintained a sullen silence. Whilst the Crusaders
were thus making a last attempt to preserve peace, the
most horrible tumult reigned in the interior of the city.
The presence of the Latins irritated the multitude; they
assembled in the public places; they excited each other to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
vengeance; the people ran to the quarter of the Franks,
demolished several houses, and gave the rest up to pillage.
A great number of Latins, threatened with loss of life,
immediately sought an asylum in the camp of the Crusaders.
Their presence, their accounts, their complaints, fired the
easily kindled indignation of the knights and barons. From
that moment the leaders saw no hopes but in the chance of
war and in the protection of the Heaven that had confided
to their hands the cause of innocence and misfortune.</p>

<p>Eighty knights succeeded in putting to flight a numerous
body of troops that the emperor had sent across the Bosphorus.
“The Greek commanders,” says Nicetas, “were
more timid than deer, and did not dare to resist men whom
they called <i>exterminating angels, statues of bronze</i>, which
spread around terror and death.” The Crusaders, however,
had great cause to fear that the Greeks, recovered from their
first panic, might become aware of the small number of
their enemies, and succeed in overwhelming them by their
multitudes; they resolved, therefore, to take advantage of
the fear they had inspired, and gave their whole attention to
forward the preparations for attacking enemies that had
provided nothing for their defence.</p>

<p>The Christian army assembled at Chrisopolis (Scutari<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>),
and beheld full in front of them the capital of the Greek
empire. After having put to flight some troops sent out to
follow their march or skirmish with them, the leaders
mounted on horseback and deliberated in full assembly, on
the plan of action best to be pursued. They decided that the
army should cross the canal of the Bosphorus, and encamp
under the walls of Constantinople. “Then,” says Villehardouin,
“the bishops and the clergy addressed their remonstrances
to all those of the camp, exhorting them to confess
themselves, and make their testaments, for they did not
know the hour at which it might please God to call them,
and do his will by them; which they did very willingly, and
with great zeal and devotion.” When all was ready, and the
Crusaders had invoked the protection of Heaven by their
prayers, the signal for departure was given; the war-horses,
saddled and covered with their long caparisons, were embarked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
in the flat-bottomed boats; the knights stood erect
near their horses, helm on head and lance in hand; the
remainder of the troops went on board the large ships, each
of which was towed by a galley. The army of the Greeks,
commanded by the emperor in person, was drawn up in
battle array on the opposite shore, and appeared disposed to
dispute the passage of the Crusaders. All at once the vessels
heaved their anchors to the sounds of trumpets and clarions.
Every soldier, with his eyes fixed on Constantinople, swore
to conquer or die. On approaching the shore, the barons
and knights cast themselves into the sea, fully armed, and
contended for the honour of first gaining the strand occupied
by the Greeks. The archers and foot-soldiers followed the
example of the knights; in less than an hour the whole army
was on the other side of the Bosphorus, and looked about
in vain for an enemy over a plain they had so recently seen
covered with arms and warriors. The army of Alexius took
to flight; and, if we may believe a letter of the count de
St. Pol, the swiftest arrows of the Latins could scarcely
overtake a few of the fugitives. The Crusaders, following up
their advantage, found the camp of the Greeks abandoned,
and plundered the tents of the emperor, without meeting
with one of his soldiers.</p>

<p>Night surprised them in the midst of their bloodless
victory; and on the morrow they resolved to attack the
fortress of Galata, which, erected upon a hill, commanded
the port of Constantinople. From break of day the Greeks
rushed in crowds to anticipate and surprise the Latins. At
the first shock, Jacques d’Avesnes was wounded grievously,
and placed <i>hors de combat</i>; the sight of his wound highly
incensed the Flemish warriors, who precipitated themselves
with fury into the <i>mêlée</i>. The Greeks were not able to
withstand the impetuous attack of their enemies, and took
to flight in great disorder; some, hoping to find an asylum
in the ships in the port, perished in the waves, whilst others
fled bewildered to the citadel, into which the conquerors
entered with the conquered. Whilst the French thus got
possession of Galata, the Venetian fleet, which was drawn up
in line of battle before Scutari, turned its prows towards the
port of Constantinople. The entrance of the gulf was
defended by an enormous chain of iron, and by twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
galleys, which constituted the whole navy of the empire.
The resistance of the Greeks was obstinate; but a vessel of
extraordinary size, assisted by a favourable wind, struck the
extended chain violently in its passage, and divided it with
enormous shears of steel, which opened and shut by the
operation of a machine.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> The galleys of the Greeks were
soon taken, or dispersed in fragments on the face of the
waters, and the whole of the Venetian fleet rode in triumph
into the port: it was then the Greeks were able to perceive
what they had to dread from the invincible courage of
these barbarians, who had till that period been the object of
their contempt.</p>

<p>The French, masters of Galata, divided their army into
six great battles or divisions. Baldwin, who had under his
orders a great number of archers and crossbow-men, led the
van. The rear was composed of Lombards, Germans, and
Franks, from countries near the Alps, commanded by the
marquis of Montferrat. The other four divisions, in which
were ranged the crusaders from Champagne, Burgundy, and
the banks of the Seine and the Loire, had at their head
Henry, brother of Baldwin, the counts of St. Pol and Blois,
and Matthew de Montmorenci.</p>

<p>This army advanced<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> towards the west of the city, without
meeting with a single foe in its passage, and encamped
between the gate of Blachernæ and the tower of Bohemond.</p>

<p>The Greeks, in a single battle, had lost the empire of the
sea, and had no longer the power to defend the approach to
their capital. The Venetian fleet cast anchor near the
mouth of the river Barbysses.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> The Venetians, masters of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the port, were secure from all surprise, and had no cause to
fear being overpowered by numbers. If the whole army had
been united on board the fleet, there is very little doubt it
would have more easily triumphed over the efforts and
multitudes of the Greeks, and it was the advice of the doge
that such should be the plan; but the knights and barons
could not be prevailed upon to fight on an element with
which they were unacquainted; and they answered (we quote
Villehardouin), that they could not act so well upon the sea
as they could upon the land, where they could have their
horses and their arms. Their army, which did not muster
twenty thousand men under its banners, attacked without
fear a city, which, according to the account of some historians,
contained a million of inhabitants, and more than
two hundred thousand men able to bear arms.</p>

<p>Before they began the assault, the Crusaders deemed it
proper once more to invite the Greeks to make peace, by
receiving the son of Isaac as emperor; and several barons
drew near to the walls, crying with a loud voice that there
was still time to listen to justice. Young Alexius was
surrounded by the Latin leaders, and his presence among
them explained sufficiently clearly the meaning of the words
addressed to the inhabitants of Constantinople. Their only
reply was hurling stones and javelins at the Crusaders; the
people of Byzantium had been persuaded that young Alexius
came for the purpose of changing the manners, religion, and
laws of Greece.</p>

<p>History ought to add here, that since the intrigues of
ambition and the caprices of fortune had enjoyed the privilege
of bestowing masters upon them, the Greeks beheld
with indifference the successions of power or the changes of
their princes; the Greek nations had not forgotten that it
was a revolution that lifted the family of Isaac to the imperial
throne. With the impressions this family had left in
their minds, the misfortunes and prayers of Alexius did not
move them sufficiently to declare in his favour, or take
arms to support his cause; since they were obliged to
choose between two new princes, he who was reigning
amongst them appeared preferable to him who implored their
aid.</p>

<p>From that time the attention and efforts of the Crusaders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
were solely directed to the prosecution of their perilous
enterprise. Their camp, placed between the gate of Blachernæ,
and the castle of Bohemond, occupied but a very
small space before walls many leagues in extent. Every day
the Greeks made sorties; the country round was covered
with the soldiers of the enemy; the army of the besiegers
appeared to be themselves besieged by troops that were
unceasingly renewed. Day and night the Crusaders were
under arms, and had neither time to take their food nor
refresh themselves by sleep. They had only provisions for
three weeks, and could look for safety to nothing but a
speedy victory; nevertheless, they continued to fill up the
ditches, and make their approaches to the ramparts. Balistas,
catapultas, rams, everything that could carry destruction
and death into the city, were employed to second the
bravery and indefatigable ardour of the besiegers; without
cessation, enormous masses fell with fearful crash from the
tops of the walls; and such was the surprising power of the
machines of war then in use, that the houses and palaces of
Constantinople were often shaken to their foundations by
stones launched from the camp of the Latins.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>After ten days of labour and fighting, the Crusaders determined
to storm the city. On the morning of the 17th of
July, 1203, the trumpets and clarions sounded the signal;
the count of Flanders, who commanded the attack, passed
through the ranks, and directed the attention of his knights
to the ramparts of Constantinople, <i>as the road which would
conduct them to an eternal glory</i>. The army was immediately
in motion, and every machine was directed against the
walls. One tower, which had fallen in with a great crash,
appeared to offer a passage to the troops of Baldwin.
Ladders were planted, and the most intrepid contended for
the honour of entering first into the city; but, this time,
numbers prevailed over valour. A host of Greeks, encouraged
by the presence of the Varangians and Pisans, hastened
to the rampart, and overturned the ladders. Fifteen Frank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
warriors, braving stones, beams, and torrents of Greek fire,
alone were able to maintain themselves on the walls, and
yielded only after fighting with desperate valour. Two of
these intrepid warriors were led to the emperor, who
watched the fight from the windows of the palace of Blachernæ.
Alexius had ceased to despise the Latins; and, in his
fright, he had such an idea of their courage, that the sight of
the two prisoners appeared to him a victory.</p>

<p>At the same time the Venetians attacked the city by sea.
Dandolo ranged his fleet in two lines; the galleys were in
the first rank, manned by archers, and laden with machines
of war; behind the galleys advanced the large vessels, upon
which were constructed towers exceeding the loftiest of the
walls of Constantinople in height. At daybreak the contest
began between the city and the fleet; the Greeks,
armed with the Greek fire, the Venetians, covered with their
armour, the ramparts and the vessels charged with a thousand
destructive instruments, cast from one to the other, by
turns, terror, fire, and death. The incessant dashing of the
oars, the shocks of the vessels against each other, the cries
of the sailors and combatants, the hissing of the stones,
javelins, and arrows, the Greek fire darting along the sea,
seizing on the ships and boiling upon the waves, presented
altogether a spectacle a thousand times more fearful than
that of a tempest. Amidst this horrible tumult, Henry
Dandolo was heard: standing erect in his galley, he excited
his troops, and, with a terrible voice, threatened to hang
every man that did not land. The orders of the intrepid
doge were soon executed. The men of his galley took him
in their arms and bore him swiftly to the shore, the standard
of St. Mark floating over him. At sight of this, the efforts
of the crews of the other galleys were redoubled, all struck
the shore, and the soldiers rushed forward to follow their
venerable leader. The vessels, which had hitherto remained
motionless, now advanced and placed themselves between
the galleys, so that the whole fleet was extended in a single
line before the walls of Constantinople, and presented to the
terrified Greeks a formidable rampart raised upon the
waters. The floating towers lowered their drawbridges
upon the ramparts of the city, and whilst, at the foot of the
walls, ten thousand arms planted ladders and battered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
rams, on the summit a fearful conflict was maintained with
sword and lance.</p>

<p>All at once the standard of St. Mark appeared upon one
of the towers, planted by an invisible hand; upon seeing
this the Venetians uttered a loud shout of joy, persuaded
that their patron saint fought at their head; their courage
proportionately increased with the terror and despair of
their enemies; the most intrepid cast themselves on to the
walls, and soon twenty-five towers were in their possession.
They pursued the Greeks into the city; but fearing to fall
into some ambush or be overwhelmed by the people, crowds
of whom filled the streets and covered the public places,
they set fire to the houses as they came to them on their
passage. The conflagration extended rapidly,<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> and drove
before it the terrified and trembling multitude. Whilst the
flames, preceding the conquerors, spread devastation on
their path, and the greatest disorder prevailed in Constantinople,
Alexius, pressed by the cries of the people, mounted
on horseback, and ordered a sortie of the troops, by three
different gates, to attack the French, who were less fortunate
in this day’s fight than the Venetians.</p>

<p>The army conducted by the emperor was composed of
sixty battalions; clothed in all the marks of imperial dignity,
Alexius rode along the ranks, animated his soldiers, and
promised them victory. At his approach, the Crusaders
abandoned the ramparts, and drew up in line of battle
before their camp.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Villehardouin admits that the bravest
knights were, for a moment, seized with fear. Dandolo,
who saw the danger in which the French were placed, abandoned
his victory, and flew to their aid. But all the Crusaders
united, could not have resisted the imperial army, if
the Greeks, but more particularly their leaders, had shown
a spark of courage. The troops of Alexius would not advance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
nearer than within bow-shot, and contented themselves
with showering a multitude of arrows from a safe distance.
The son-in-law of the emperor, Lascaris, of whose courage
the Greeks and even the Latins boast, demanded with loud
cries that the Crusaders should be attacked in their intrenchments;
but he could not prevail upon Alexius, surrounded
by base courtiers who endeavoured to communicate their
own alarms to him, and assured him that he had done enough
for his glory in showing himself to his enemies. The emperor,
without having fought, ordered a retreat to be sounded,
and his numerous troops, who still bore the name of Romans,
and before whom the eagles of Rome were carried, returned
with him into Constantinople.</p>

<p>Every quarter of the capital resounded with lamentations
and groans; the Greeks were more terrified at the cowardice
of their defenders, than by the bravery of their enemies;
the people accused the army, and the army accused Alexius.
The emperor mistrusting the Greeks and dreading the Latins,
now only thought of saving his own life: he abandoned his
family, his friends, his capital; he embarked secretly in the
darkness of night, and fled to seek a retreat in some obscure
corner of his empire.</p>

<p>When daylight informed the Greeks that they had no
longer an emperor, the disorder and excitement of the city
became excessive; the people assembled in the streets, and
freely discussed the errors and deficiencies of their leaders,
the infamy of the favourites, and their own misfortunes.
Now Alexius had abandoned his power, they remembered
the crime of his usurpation, and a thousand voices were
raised to invoke the anger of Heaven upon his head.
Amidst the confusion and tumult, the wisest were at a loss
what part to take, when the courtiers rushed to the prison
in which Isaac languished, broke his chains, and led him in
triumph to the palace of Blachernæ. Although blind, he
was placed upon the throne, and, whilst he believed himself
to be still in the hands of his executioners, his ears were
saluted with the unexpected accents of flattery; on seeing
him again clothed in the imperial purple, the courtiers for
the first time became affected by misfortunes he no longer
endured. All denied having been partisans of Alexius, and
related what vows they had put up for his cause. They next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
sought out the wife of Isaac, whom they had forgotten, and
who had lived in a retreat to which no one knew or had
inquired the road during the preceding reign.</p>

<p>Euphrosyne, the wife of the fugitive emperor, was accused
of having endeavoured to take advantage of the troubles of
Constantinople, to clothe one of her favourites with the
purple. She was cast into a dungeon, and reproached with
all the evils that had fallen on her country, but most particularly
with the lengthened miseries of Isaac. Such as
had been loaded with favours by this princess, were conspicuous
among her accusers, and pretended to make a merit
of their ingratitude.</p>

<p>In political troubles, every change is, in the eyes of the
people, a means of safety; they felicitated themselves upon
this new revolution in Constantinople; hope revived in all
hearts, and Isaac was saluted by the multitude with cries of
joy and congratulation. Rumour soon carried to the camp
all that had taken place in the city. At this news the
council of the barons and knights was assembled in the tent
of the marquis of Montferrat, and they returned thanks to
Providence, which in delivering Constantinople, had, at the
same time, delivered them from the greatest dangers. But
when they recollected having seen only on the preceding
day the emperor Alexius surrounded by an innumerable
army, they could scarcely give faith to the miracle of his
flight.</p>

<p>The camp was, however, soon crowded with a multitude
of Greeks, who came to relate the wonders of which they
had been witnesses. Many of the courtiers who had not
been able to attract the attention of Isaac, flocked to young
Alexius, in the hope of securing his first favours; they
returned warm thanks to Heaven for having listened to the
ardent vows they had put up for his return, and conjured
him, in the name of his country and the empire, to come
and share the honours and the power of his father. But all
these testimonies could not persuade the Latins, so accustomed
were they to mistrust the Greeks. The barons kept
their army in the strictest order, and always prepared for
battle, and then sent Matthew of Montmorenci, Geoffrey
de Villehardouin, and two Venetian nobles to Constantinople
to ascertain the truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>The deputies were directed to congratulate Isaac, if he
had recovered his throne, and to require of him the ratification
of the treaty made with his son. On arriving in Constantinople,
they were conducted to the palace of Blachernæ
between two ranks of soldiers, who, the day before, had
formed the body-guard of Alexius, and who had just taken
the oath to defend Isaac. The emperor received the deputies
on a throne sparkling with gold and precious stones,
and surrounded by all the splendour of Eastern courts.
“This is the manner,” said Villehardouin, addressing Isaac,
“in which the Crusaders have fulfilled their promises; it
now remains with you to perform those that have been made
in your name. Your son, who is with the lords and barons,
implores you to ratify the treaty he has concluded, and commands
us to say that he will not return to your palace until
you have sworn to perform all he has promised us.” Alexius
had engaged to pay the Crusaders two hundred thousand
silver marks, to furnish their army with provisions for a
year, to take an active part in the perils and labours of the
holy war, and to reduce the Greek Church to submission to
that of Rome. When Isaac heard the conditions of the
treaty, he could not forbear from expressing his surprise,
and pointing out to the deputies how difficult it must be to
perform such promises; but he could deny nothing to his
liberators, and thanked the Crusaders for not requiring
more:<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> “<i>You have served us so well</i>,” added he, “<i>that if we
were even to give you the whole empire, you would have
merited it</i>.” The deputies praised the frankness and good
faith of Isaac, and carried back to the camp the imperial
patents, to which was affixed the seal of gold that confirmed
the treaty made with Alexius.</p>

<p>The lords and barons immediately mounted on horseback,
and conducted young Alexius into Constantinople. The son
of Isaac rode between the count of Flanders and the doge
of Venice, followed by all the knights, clad in complete
armour. The people, who so lately had preserved a sullen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
silence on beholding him, now crowded around him on his
passage, and saluted him with loud acclamations; the Latin
clergy accompanied the son of Isaac, and those of the Greek
Church sent out their magnificent <i>cortège</i> to meet him. The
entrance of the young prince into the capital was a day of
festivity for both the Greeks and the Latins; in all the
churches thanks were offered up to Heaven; hymns of
public rejoicing resounded everywhere; but it was particularly
in the palace of Blachernæ, so long the abode of
mourning and fear, that the greatest transports of joy were
manifested. A father, blind, and immured during eight
years in a dungeon, clasping in his arms a son to whom he
owed the restoration of his liberty and crown, presented a
new spectacle that must have penetrated every heart with
lively emotions. The crowd of spectators recalled to their
minds the long calamities of these two princes; and the
remembrance of so many evils past, appeared to them a
pledge for the blessings that Heaven had in store for the
empire.</p>

<p>The emperor, reunited to his son, again thanked the
Crusaders for the services they had rendered him, and conjured
the leaders to establish themselves with their army on
the other side of the Gulf of Chrysoceras. He feared that
their abode in the city might give birth to some quarrel
between the Greeks and the Latins, too long divided. The
barons yielded to the prayer of Isaac and Alexius, and the
army of the Crusaders took up their quarters in the faubourg
of Galata; where, in abundance and repose, they forgot the
labours, perils, and fatigues of the war. The Pisans, who had
defended Constantinople against the Crusaders, made peace
with the Venetians; all discords were appeased, and no
spirit of jealousy or rivalry divided the Franks. The Greeks
came constantly to the camp of the Latins, bringing provisions
and merchandise of all kinds. The warriors of the
West often visited the capital, and were never tired of
contemplating the palaces of the emperors, the numerous
edifices, the masterpieces of art, the monuments consecrated
to religion, and, above all, the relics of saints, which, according
to the marshal of Champagne, were in greater abundance
in Constantinople than in any other place in the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>A few days after his entrance into Constantinople, Alexius
was crowned in the church of St. Sophia, and admitted to a
partition of the sovereign power with his father. The barons
assisted at his coronation, and offered up sincere wishes for
the happiness of his reign. Alexius hastened to discharge a
part of the sum promised to the Crusaders. The greatest harmony
prevailed between the people of Byzantium and the
warriors of the West; the Greeks appeared to have forgotten
their defeats, the Latins their victories. The subjects of Isaac
and Alexius mingled with the Latins without mistrust, and
the simplicity of the Franks was no longer the subject of their
raillery. The Crusaders, on their side, confided in the good
faith of the Greeks. Peace reigned in the capital, and
seemed to be the work of their hands. They respected the
two princes they had placed upon the throne, and the emperors
retained an affectionate gratitude for their liberators.</p>

<p>The Crusaders, having become the allies of the Greeks,
and the protectors of a great empire, had now no other
enemies to contend with but the Saracens; and they turned
their minds to the fulfilment of the oath they had made on
taking the cross; but, ever faithful to the laws of chivalry,
the barons and knights deemed it right to declare war
before beginning it. Heralds-at-arms were sent to the
sultan of Cairo and Damascus, to announce to him, in the
name of Jesus Christ, in the name of the emperor of Constantinople,
and in the names of the princes and nobles of
the West, that he would soon experience the valour of the
Christian nations, if he persisted in holding under his laws
the Holy Land and the places consecrated by the presence
of the Saviour.</p>

<p>The leaders of the crusade announced the wonderful success
of their enterprise to all the princes and nations of
Christendom. Whilst addressing the emperor of Germany,<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
they conjured him to take part in the crusade, and come
and place himself at the head of the Christian knights. The
account of their exploits excited the enthusiasm of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
faithful; the news, when carried into Syria, spread terror
among the Saracens, and revived the hopes of the king of
Jerusalem and the defenders of the Holy Land: so much
glorious success ought to have satisfied the pride and valour
of the Crusaders; but, whilst the world resounded with
their glory, and trembled at the fame of their arms, the
knights and barons believed they had achieved nothing for
their own renown, or for the cause of God, until they had
obtained the approbation of the Holy See. The marquis of
Montferrat, the count of Flanders, the count of St. Pol,
and the principal leaders of the army, when writing to the
pope, represented to him that the success of their enterprise
was not the work of men, but the work of God. These
warriors, filled with haughty pride, who had just conquered
an empire; who, according to Nicetas, boasted of <i>fearing
nothing but the falling of the heavens</i>, thus bent their victorious
brows before the tribunal of the sovereign pontiff,
and protested at the feet of Innocent, that no mundane
view had directed their arms, and that he must only contemplate
in them the instruments Providence had employed in
accomplishing its designs.</p>

<p>Young Alexius, in concert with the leaders of the crusades,
wrote at the same time to the pope, to justify his conduct
and that of his liberators. “We avow,” said he, “that the
principal cause that induced the pilgrims to assist us, was
that we had promised, with an oath, to recognise the Roman
pontiff as our ecclesiastical head, and the successor of St.
Peter.” Innocent III. in replying to the new emperor of
Constantinople, praised his intentions and his zeal, and
pressed him to accomplish his promises; but the excuses of
the Crusaders were not able to appease the resentment
which the pope retained on account of their disobedience to
the counsels and commands of the Holy See. In his answer,
he did not salute them with his usual benediction, fearing
that they were again fallen under excommunication, by
attacking the Greek emperor in spite of his prohibition. If
the emperor of Constantinople, said he to them, does not
make haste to do that which he has promised, it will appear
that neither his intentions nor yours have been sincere, and
<i>that you have added this second sin to that you have already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
committed</i>. The pope gave the Crusaders fresh advice; but
neither his counsels nor his threats produced any better
effect than they had done at the siege of Zara: Providence
was preparing in secret, events that exceeded the foresight
of the Crusaders, or even that of the Holy See, and which
would once again change the aim and object of the holy
war.</p>

<p class="pc lmid">A.D. 1198-1204.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">When</span> war and revolutions have shaken an empire to its
foundation, evils arise against which no human wisdom can
provide. It is then that princes, called to the throne, are
more to be pitied than their subjects, and that their power
is more likely to excite commiseration than to awaken the
ambition or hatred of other men. The people, in the
extreme of misery, know not what bounds to put to their
hopes, and always demand of the future more than the
future can possibly bring. When they continue to suffer
irreparable misfortunes, they blame their leaders, by whose
influence they expected all sorts of prosperity; the murmurs
of unjust hatred soon succeed to the acclamations of an irreflective
enthusiasm, and, not unfrequently, virtue itself is
accused of having caused evils which are the effects of revolt,
war, or bad fortune.</p>

<p>Nations themselves, when they have succumbed, and have
for ever lost their political existence, are not judged with
less severity or injustice than princes or monarchs: after
the fall of an empire, the terrible axiom <i>væ victis</i>, receives
its application even in the judgment of posterity. Generations,
quite equally with contemporaries, allow themselves
to be dazzled by victory, and entertain nothing but
contempt for conquered nations. We shall endeavour,
whilst speaking of the Greeks and their princes, to guard
against the prejudices that history has transmitted to us,
and when we shall pronounce a severe judgment upon the
character and people of Greece, our opinion will be always
founded upon authentic traditions and the testimony of the
historians of Byzantium.</p>

<p>Whilst young Alexius had nothing to do but make promises
and give hopes, he was gratified by the flattering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
benedictions of both Greeks and Crusaders; but when the
time arrived for him to perform all he had promised, he met
with nothing but enemies and obstacles. In the position in
which his return had placed him, it was extremely difficult
for him to preserve at the same time the confidence of his
liberators and the love of his subjects. If, in order to
fulfil his engagements, the young emperor undertook to
unite the Greek Church with the Church of Rome; if, to
pay that which he owed to the Crusaders, he oppressed his
people with taxes, he must expect to hear violent murmurs
arise throughout his empire. If, on the contrary, he respected
the religion of Greece, if he lightened the excessive
weight of the imposts, the treaties would remain unexecuted,
and the throne he had so recently ascended, might be overturned
by the arms of the Latins.</p>

<p>Dreading every day to see the fires of either revolt or
war kindled, obliged to choose between two perils, after
having long and earnestly deliberated, he did not dare to
confide his destiny to the equivocal valour of the Greeks,
and conjured the barons to become a second time his liberators.
He repaired to the tent of the count of Flanders,
and spoke as follows to the assembled leaders of the
crusade.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> “You have restored to me life, honour, and
empire, and I have only one thing to desire: that is, to be
able to perform all the promises I have made you. But if
you abandon me now, in order to go into Syria, it will be
impossible for me to find the money, the troops, or the
vessels I have undertaken to furnish. The people of Constantinople
have received me with joy; but the frequency of
revolutions has caused them to lose the habits of submission
and obedience. The laws of their country, the majesty of
the throne, no longer inspire them with respect; a spirit of
faction reigns in the capital, and throughout the too-long
agitated provinces. I conjure you then, in the name of
your own glory, in the name of your own interests, to finish
your work, and render firm the power you have reëstablished.
Winter is approaching, the navigation is perilous, and the
rains will not permit you to commence the war in Syria;
wait then till the spring, when the sea will present fewer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
dangers, and war greater success and glory; you will then
have all Greece as auxiliaries in your enterprises; I shall
myself be able to keep the oaths that chain me to your
cause, and accompany you with an army worthy of an
emperor.” At the conclusion of his speech, Alexius promised
to furnish all that the army would require, and to
make such suitable arrangements with the doge, that the
Venetian fleet might remain at the disposal of the Crusaders
during their abode at Constantinople, and to the end of their
expedition.</p>

<p>A council was called to deliberate upon the proposals of
the young emperor: those who had been desirous of separating
themselves from the army at Zara and Corfu, represented
to the assembly that they had, until that time, fought
for the glory and profane interests of princes of the earth,
but that the time was now come for them to fight for
religion and for Jesus Christ. They were indignant at new
obstacles being raised to retard the holy enterprise. This
opinion was warmly combated by the doge of Venice and
the barons who had embarked their glory in the expedition
against Constantinople, and could not make up their minds
to lose the fruit of all their labours. “Shall we,” said they,
“allow a young prince, whose cause we have brought to a
triumphant issue, to be delivered over to his enemies, who
are as ours, and an enterprise so gloriously begun, become
for us a source of shame and repentance? Shall we allow
the heresy that our arms have stifled in humbled Greece,
to reconstruct its impure altars, and be again a subject of
scandal for the Christian church? Shall we leave the
Greeks the dangerous faculty of declaring against us, and
allying themselves with the Saracens, to war with the soldiers
of Christ?” To these weighty motives the princes and
lords did not disdain to add supplication and prayers; at
length their opinion triumphed over an obstinate opposition,
and the council decided that the departure of the army
should be deferred until the festival of the Easter of the
following year.</p>

<p>Alexius, in concert with Isaac, thanked the Crusaders for
their favourable determination, and neglected nothing that
could prove his gratitude to them. For the purpose of
paying the sums he had promised, he exhausted his treasury,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
increased the imposts, and even melted the images of the
saints and the sacred vases. Upon seeing the churches
despoiled of the sacred images, the people of Constantinople
were struck with surprise and terror, and yet had not the
courage to utter their complaints aloud. Nicetas reproaches
his compatriots bitterly with having remained quiet spectators
of such sacrilege, and accuses them of having, by their
cowardly indifference, drawn upon the empire the anger of
Heaven. The most fervent of the Greeks deplored, as
Nicetas did, the violation of their holy places; but scenes
much more grievous were soon to be brought before their
eyes.</p>

<p>The leaders of the army, influenced by the counsels of
the Latin clergy and by the fear of the pontiff of Rome,
required that the patriarch, the priests, and the monks of
Constantinople should abjure the errors that separated them
from the Romish church; and neither the clergy, nor the
people, nor the emperor, attempted to resist this demand,
although it alarmed every conscience and alienated all hearts.
The patriarch, from the pulpit of St. Sophia, declared, in his
own name, and in the name of the emperor and the Christian
people of the East, that he acknowledged <i>Innocent, third
of that name, as the successor of St. Peter, first vicar of
Jesus Christ upon earth, pastor of the faithful flock</i>. The
Greeks who were present at this ceremony believed they
beheld the abomination of desolation in the holy place, and
if they afterwards pardoned the patriarch the commission of
such a scandal, it was from the strange persuasion in which
they were, that the head of their church was deceiving the
Latins, and that the imposture of his words redeemed in
some sort the crime of blasphemy and the shame of perjury.</p>

<p>The Greeks persisted in believing that the Holy Ghost
does not proceed from the Son, and quoted in support of their
belief, the Creed of Nice; the discipline of their church
differed in some points from that of the Church of Rome;
in the early days of the schism it might have been easy to
effect a reunion, but now the disputes of theologians had
too much exasperated men’s minds.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> The hatred of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Greeks and the Latins appeared but too likely to separate
the two creeds for ever. The law that was imposed upon
the Greeks only served to promote the growth of their invincible
resistance. Such among them as scarcely knew
what the subject was of the long debates that had sprung
up between Byzantium and Rome, showed no less fanaticism
and opposition than all the others; whilst such as had no
religion at all adopted with warmth the opinions of the
theologians, and appeared all at once disposed to die for a
cause which till that time had inspired them with nothing
but indifference. The Greek people, in a word, who believed
themselves to be superior to all other nations of the earth,
repulsed with contempt all knowledge that came from the
West, and could not consent to recognise the superiority of
the Latins. The Crusaders, who had changed the emperors
and conquered the empire, were astonished at not being able
to change men’s hearts likewise; but, persuaded that everything
must in the end yield to their arms, they employed, in
subduing minds and opinions, a rigour which only augmented
the hatred of the vanquished, and prepared the fall of the
emperors whom victory had replaced upon the throne.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the usurper Alexius, on flying from
Constantinople, had found a retreat in the province of
Thrace; several cities opened their gates to him, and a few
partisans assembled under his banner. The son of Isaac
resolved to seek the rebels and give them battle. Henry of
Hainault, the count of St. Pol, and many knights, accompanied
him in this expedition. At their approach, the
usurper, shut up in Adrianople, quickly abandoned the city
and fled away towards Mount Hemus. All the rebels who
had the courage to await them, were either conquered or
dispersed. But young Alexius and the Crusaders had a
much more formidable enemy to contend with: this was the
nation of the Bulgarians. These wild and ferocious people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
obedient to the laws of Constantinople at the time of the
first crusade, had taken advantage of the troubles of the
empire to shake off the yoke of its rulers.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> The leader of the
Bulgarians, Joannices, an implacable enemy of the Greeks,
had embraced the faith of the Church of Rome, and declared
himself a vassal of the sovereign pontiff, to obtain from him
the title of king. He concealed under the veil of a new
religion the most vindictive hatred and aspiring ambition,
and employed the support and credit of the court of Rome
to make war against the masters of Byzantium. Joannices
made frequent incursions into the countries adjoining his
own territories, and threatened the richest provinces of the
empire with invasion. If young Alexius had been guided
by prudent counsels, he would have taken advantage of the
presence of the Crusaders to intimidate the Bulgarians, and
compel them to remain on the other side of Mount Hemus:
this expedition might have deservedly obtained him the confidence
and esteem of the Greeks, and assured the repose of
several provinces; but whether he was not seconded by the
Crusaders, or that he did not perceive the advantages of such
an enterprise, he contented himself with threatening Joannices;
and, without having made either peace or war, after
receiving the oaths of the cities of Thrace, his sole wish was
to return to Constantinople.</p>

<p>The capital of the empire, which had already undergone
so many evils, had just experienced a fresh calamity. Some
Flemish soldiers, encouraged by the Latins established in
Constantinople, had provoked and insulted the Jews in their
synagogue, and the people had taken up the defence of the
latter against the aggressors. Both sides had recourse to
arms, and in the tumult of fight, chance, or malevolence,
set fire to some neighbouring houses. The conflagration
extended on all sides, during the night and the following
day, with a rapidity and violence that nothing could stop or
confine; the flames meeting from several points, rolled on
with the swiftness of a torrent, consuming, as if of straw,
galleries, columns, temples, and palaces. From the bosom
of this frightful mass of fire issued fragments of burning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
matter, which, falling upon distant houses, reduced them to
ashes. The flames, at first impelled by a north wind, were
afterwards driven back, by a strong change, from the south,
and poured upon places that had appeared secure from
danger. The conflagration began at the synagogue, near
the sea, on the eastern side of the city, and extended its
ravages as far as the church of St. Sophia, on the western
side, traversing a space of two leagues, and in its course
including the port, where many ships were consumed upon
the waters.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>During eight days the fearful element continued the destruction;
the crash of houses and towers falling on all
sides, and the roaring of the winds and flames mingling with
the cries of a ruined and distracted multitude. The crowds
of inhabitants rushed over and against each other in the
streets, flying before the closely-pursuing fire, some bearing
their goods and most valuable effects, others dragging along
the sick and the aged. Such as perished in the conflagration
were the least unfortunate, for multitudes of others, weeping
the death of their relations and friends, and the loss of their
whole worldly property, many of them wounded, some half-burnt,
wandered about bewildered among the ruins, or were
huddled together in the public places, without any means of
subsistence, or the hope of finding an asylum.</p>

<p>The Crusaders viewed the progress of this horrible disaster
from the heights of Galata, and deplored the calamities
of Constantinople. A great number of knights lent their
most earnest endeavour to subdue the raging element, and
lamented that they had to contend with an enemy against
which valour was powerless. The princes and barons sent a
deputation to the emperor Isaac, to assure him how sincerely
they participated in his sorrow, and to declare that they
would punish the authors of the conflagration with the
utmost severity, if they should prove to be among their soldiers.
The protestations and assistance which they promptly
and earnestly offered to the victims, could neither console
nor appease the Greeks, who, whilst contemplating the ruins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
and misfortunes of their capital, accused the two emperors,
and threw out horrible imprecations against the Latins.</p>

<p>The families of the Franks established at Constantinople,
who, in spite of persecutions, had remained in the city,
became again subject to the ill-treatment of the people; and,
forced to seek an asylum without the walls, they took refuge
in the faubourg of Galata. Their groans and complaints
revived all the animosity of the Crusaders against the
Greeks. Thus everything contributed to inflame the hatred
of two nations, whom such great misfortunes ought to have
more closely united, and to rekindle discords that were
doomed to bring in their train new and incurable calamities.</p>

<p>When Alexius re-entered Constantinople in triumph, the
people received him with moody silence; the Crusaders alone
applauded victories he had gained over Greeks; and his
triumph, which contrasted so keenly with the public calamities,
and his laurels, gathered in a civil war, only served
to render him more odious to the inhabitants of his capital.
He was obliged, more than ever, to throw himself into the
arms of the Latins; he passed his days and nights in their
camp; he took part in their warlike games, and associated
himself with their gross orgies. Amidst the intoxication of
banquets, the Frank warriors treated Alexius with insolent
familiarity, and more than once they pulled off his jewelled
diadem to place on his head the woollen cap worn by Venetian
sailors. The Greeks, who took great pride in the magnificence
of their sovereigns, only conceived the stronger
contempt for a prince, who, after abjuring his religion, degraded
the imperial dignity, and did not blush to adopt the
manners of nations that were only known at Constantinople
under the name of barbarians.</p>

<p>Nicetas, whose opinions are not wanting in moderation,
never speaks of this prince but with a sort of anger and violence.
According to the historian of Byzantium, “Alexius
had a countenance resembling that of the exterminating
angel; he was a true incendiary; and far from being afflicted
by the burning of his capital, he would have wished to see
the whole city reduced to ashes.” Isaac himself accused
his son of having pernicious inclinations, and of corrupting
himself daily by an intercourse with the wicked; he was indignant
that the name of Alexius should be proclaimed at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
court and in public ceremonies, whilst that of Isaac was
rarely mentioned. In his blind anger, he loaded the young
emperor with imprecations; but, governed by a vain jealousy,
much more than by any proper sentiment of dignity, whilst
he applauded the hatred of the people for Alexius, he evaded
the duties of a sovereign, and did nothing to merit the
esteem of men of worth. Isaac lived retired in his palace,
surrounded by monks and astrologers, who, whilst kissing his
hands still scarred with the irons of his captivity, celebrated
his power, made him believe that he would deliver Jerusalem,
that he would plant his throne upon Mount Libanus, and
would reign over the whole universe. Full of confidence in
an image of the Virgin which he always carried with him,
and boasting of being acquainted, by means of astrology,
with all the secrets of policy, he could yet imagine, to prevent
sedition, nothing more effective than to have transported
from the hippodrome to his palace, the statue of the
wild boar of Calydon, which was considered the symbol of
revolt and the image of an infuriated people.</p>

<p>The people of Constantinople, no less superstitious than
Isaac, whilst deploring the evils of their country, laid the
blame upon both marble and brass. A statue of Minerva
which decorated the Square of Constantine, had its eyes and
arms turned towards the West; it was believed that she had
called in the barbarians, and the statue was torn down and
dashed to pieces by an exasperated mob:<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> “cruel blindness of
the Greeks,” cries an historical <i>bel esprit</i>,<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> “who took arms
against themselves, and could not endure in their city
the image of a goddess who presides over prudence and
valour!”</p>

<p>Whilst the capital of the empire was thus agitated by
popular commotions, the ministers of Alexius and Isaac
were busied in levying taxes for the payment of the sums
promised to the Latins. Extravagance, abuses of power,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
and numerous instances of injustice, added still further to
the public calamities; loud complaints were proclaimed by
every class of the citizens. It was at first intended to lay
the principal burden of the imposts upon the people; but the
people, says Nicetas, arose like a sea agitated by the winds.
Extraordinary taxes were then, by necessity, laid upon the
richer citizens, and the churches continued to be plundered
of their gold and silver ornaments. All the treasures they
could collect were not sufficient to satisfy the insatiable
desires of the Latins, who began to ravage the country, and
pillage the houses and monasteries of the Propontis.</p>

<p>The hostilities and violence of the Crusaders excited the
indignation of the people to a greater degree than they
moved that of the patricians and the great. In the course of
so many revolutions, it is astonishing to find that the spirit
of patriotism so frequently revives amongst the multitude,
when it is extinct in the more elevated classes. In a corrupt
nation, so long as revolutions have not broken forth,
and the day of peril and destruction is not arrived, the
riches of the citizens is a sure pledge of their devotedness
and patriotism; but this pledge is no longer the same at the
height of danger, when society finds itself in antagonism
with all the enemies of its existence and its repose; a fortune,
the loss of which is dreaded, is often the cause of
shameful transactions with the party of the conquerors; it
enervates more than it fortifies moral courage. Amidst the
greatest perils, the multitude, who have nothing to lose,
sometimes preserve generous passions that skilful policy
may direct with advantage. Unfortunately, the same multitude
scarcely ever obey anything but a blind instinct; and
in moments of crisis, become a dangerous instrument in
the hands of the ambitious, who abuse the names of liberty
and patriotism. It is then that a nation has no less to complain
of those who are not willing to save her, than of those
who do not dare defend her; and that she perishes, the victim
at once of culpable indifference and senseless ardour.</p>

<p>The people of Constantinople, irritated against the enemies
of the empire, and urged on by a spirit of faction,
complained at first of their leaders; and, soon passing from
complaint to revolt, they rushed in a crowd to the palace of
the emperors, reproached them with having abandoned the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
cause of God and the cause of their country, and demanded,
with loud cries, avengers and arms.</p>

<p>Among those who encouraged the multitude, a young
prince of the illustrious family of Ducas was conspicuous.
He bore the name of Alexius, a name which must always be
associated with the history of the misfortunes of the empire:
in addition, he had obtained the surname of <i>Mourzoufle</i>, a
Greek word, signifying that his two eyebrows met together.
Mourzoufle<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> concealed a subtle spirit beneath that severe
and stern air that the vulgar never fail to take for an indication
of frankness. The words patriotism and liberty, which
always seduce the people; the words glory and religion,
which recall noble sentiments, were for ever in his mouth,
and only served to veil the machinations of his ambition.
Amidst a timid and pusillanimous court, surrounded by
princes, who, according to the expression of Nicetas, <i>had
greater fear of making war against the Crusaders, than stags
would have in attacking a lion</i>, Mourzoufle was not deficient
in bravery, and his reputation for courage was quite sufficient
to draw upon him the eyes of the whole capital. As he
possessed a strong voice, a haughty look, and an imperious
tone, he was pronounced fit to command. The more vehemently
he declaimed against tyranny, the more ardent were
the wishes of the multitude that he should be clothed with
great power. The hatred that he affected to entertain for
foreigners, gave birth to the hope that he would one day
defend the empire, and caused him to be considered the
future liberator of Constantinople.</p>

<p>Skilful in seizing every available chance, and in following
all parties, after having rendered criminal services to the
usurper, Mourzoufle gathered the reward of them under the
reign that followed the usurpation; and he who was everywhere
accused of having been the gaoler and executioner of
Isaac,<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> became the favourite of young Alexius. He neglected
no means of pleasing the multitude, in order to render
himself necessary to the prince; and knew how to
brave, on fit occasions, the hatred of the courtiers, to augment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
his credit among the people. He was not tardy in
taking advantage of this double influence to sow the
seeds of new troubles, and bring about the triumph of his
ambition.</p>

<p>His counsels persuaded young Alexius, that it was necessary
for him to break with the Latins, and prove himself
ungrateful to his liberators, to obtain the confidence of the
Greeks; he inflamed the minds of the people, and to make
a rupture certain, he himself took up arms. His friends
and some men of the people followed his example, and, led
by Mourzoufle, a numerous troop rushed from the city, in
the hope of surprising the Latins; but the multitude, always
ready to declaim against the warriors of the West, did not
dare to face them. Mourzoufle, abandoned on the field of
battle, had nearly fallen into the hands of the Crusaders.
This imprudent action, that might have been expected to
ruin him, only tended to increase his power and influence;
he might be accused of having risked the safety of the empire
by provoking a war without the means of sustaining it;
but the people boasted of the heroism of a young prince,
who had dared to brave the warlike hosts of the Franks;
and even they who had deserted him in the fight, celebrated
his valour, and swore, as he did, to exterminate the enemies
of their country.</p>

<p>The frenzy of the Greeks was at its height; and, on their
side, the Latins loudly expressed their dissatisfaction. In
the faubourg of Galata, inhabited by the French and Venetians,
as well as within the walls of Constantinople, nothing
was heard but cries for war, and nobody durst speak of
peace. At this period a deputation from the Christians of
Palestine arrived in the camp of the Crusaders. The deputies,
the principal of whom was Martin Litz, were clothed
in mourning vestments, which, with the sadness of their
aspect, made it sufficiently plain that they came to announce
fresh misfortunes. Their accounts drew tears from all the
pilgrims.</p>

<p>In the year that preceded the expedition to Constantinople
the Flemish and Champenois Crusaders, who had embarked
at the ports of Bruges and Marseilles, landed at Ptolemaïs.
At the same time came many English warriors, commanded
by the earls of Northumberland, Norwich, and Salisbury;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
and a great number of pilgrims from Lower Brittany, who
had chosen for leader the monk Hélain, one of the preachers
of the crusade. These Crusaders, when united with those
who had quitted the Christian army after the siege of Zara,
became impatient to attack the Saracens, and as the king of
Jerusalem was averse to breaking the truce made with the
infidels, the greater part of them left Palestine, to fight
under the banners of the prince of Antioch, who was at
war with the prince of Armenia. Having refused to take
guides, they were surprised and dispersed by a body of
Saracens, sent against them by the sultan of Aleppo;<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> the
few that escaped from the carnage, among whom history
names two seigneurs de Neuilly, Bernard de Montmirail, and
Renard de Dampierre, remained in the chains of the infidels.
Hélain, the monk, had the grief to see the bravest of the
Breton Crusaders perish on the field of battle, and returned
almost alone to Ptolemaïs, to announce the bloody defeat of
the soldiers of the cross. A horrible famine had, during
two years, desolated Egypt, and extended its ravages into
Syria. Contagious diseases followed the famine; the plague
swept away the inhabitants of the Holy Land; more than
two thousand Christians had received the rights of sepulture
in the city of Ptolemaïs, in one single day!</p>

<p>The deputies from the Holy Land, after rendering their
melancholy account, invoked by tears and groans the prompt
assistance of the army of the Crusaders; but the barons
and knights could not abandon the enterprise they had
begun; they promised the envoys from Palestine that they
would turn their arms towards Syria, as soon as they had
subdued the Greeks; and, pointing towards the walls of
Constantinople, said: “<i>This is the road to salvation; this is
the way to Jerusalem.</i>”</p>

<p>Alexius was bound to pay the Latins the sums he had
promised; if he was faithful to his word, he had to apprehend
a revolt of the Greeks; if he did not fulfil his engagements,
he dreaded the arms of the Crusaders. Terrified by
the general agitation that prevailed, and restrained by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
double fear, the two emperors remained inactive in their
palace, without daring to seek for peace, or prepare for war.</p>

<p>The Crusaders, dissatisfied with the conduct of Alexius,<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
deputed several barons and knights to demand of him
peremptorily whether he would be their friend or their
enemy. The deputies, on entering Constantinople, heard
nothing throughout their passage but the insults and threats
of an irritated populace. Received in the palace of Blachernæ,
amidst the pomp of the throne and the court,<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> they
addressed the emperor Alexius, and expressed the complaints
of their companions in arms in these terms: “We are sent
by the French barons and the doge of Venice to recall to
your mind the treaty that you and your father have sworn
to upon the Gospel, and to require you to fulfil your promises
as we have fulfilled ours. If you do us justice, we
shall only have to forget the past, and give due praise to
your good faith; if you are not true to your oaths, the
Crusaders will no longer remember they have been your
friends and allies, they will have recourse to no more prayers,
but to their own good swords. They have felt it their duty
to lay their complaints before you, and to warn you of their
intentions, for the warriors of the West hold treachery in
horror, and never make war without having declared it; we
offer you our friendship, which has placed you upon the
throne, or our hatred, which is able to remove you from it;
we bring you war with all its calamities, or peace with all
its blessings: it is for you to choose, and to deliberate upon
the part you have to take.”</p>

<p>These complaints of the Crusaders were expressed with
so little respect, that they must have been highly offensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
to the ears of the emperors. In this palace, which constantly
resounded with the acclamations of a servile court,
the sovereigns of Byzantium had never listened to language
so insolent and haughty. The emperor Alexius, to whom
this menacing tone appeared to reveal his own helplessness
and the unhappy state of his empire, could not restrain his
indignation; the courtiers fully partook of the anger of
their masters, and were desirous of punishing the insolent
orator of the Latins on the spot;<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> but the deputies left the
palace of Blachernæ, and hastened to regain the camp of the
Crusaders.</p>

<p>The council of Isaac and Alexius breathed nothing but
vengeance; and, on the return of the deputies, war was decided
on in the council of the barons. The Latins determined
to attack Constantinople; nothing could equal the
hatred and fury of the Greeks; but fury and hatred
cannot supply the place of courage: not daring to meet
their enemy in the open field, they resolved to burn the fleet
of the Venetians. The Greeks, on this occasion, had again
recourse to that Greek fire, which had, more than once,
served them instead of courage, and saved their capital.
This terrible fire, skilfully hurled or directed, devoured
vessels, soldiers, and their arms; like the bolt of Heaven,
nothing could prevent its explosion, or arrest its ravages;
the waves of the sea, so far from extinguishing it, redoubled
its activity. Seventeen ships, charged with the Greek fire
and combustible matter, were carried by a favourable wind
towards the port in which the Venetian vessels lay at anchor.
To assure the success of this attempt, the Greeks took
advantage of the darkness of night; and the port, the
gulf, and the faubourg of Galata were, all at once, illumined
by a threatening and sinister light. At the aspect of the
danger, the trumpets sounded the alarm in the camp of the
Latins; the French flew to arms and prepared for the fight,
whilst the Venetians cast themselves into their barks, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
went out to meet vessels bearing within their sides destruction
and fire.</p>

<p>The crowd of Greeks assembled on the shore, applauded
the spectacle, and enjoyed the terror of the Crusaders.
Many of them embarked in small boats, and rowed out
upon the sea, darting arrows and endeavouring to carry disorder
among the Venetians. The Crusaders encouraged
each other; they rushed in crowds to encounter the danger,
some raising plaintive and piercing cries towards Heaven,
and others uttering horrible imprecations against the Greeks:
on the walls of Constantinople, clapping of hands and cries
of joy resounded, and were redoubled as the vessels covered
with flames drew nearer. Villehardouin, an ocular witness,
says that amidst this frightful tumult, nature appeared to be
in confusion, and the sea about to swallow up the earth.
Nevertheless, the Venetians, by the means of strong arms
and numberless oars, succeeded in turning the course of the
fire-ships wide of the port, and they were carried by the
current beyond the canal. The Crusaders, in battle array,
standing on their vessels or dispersed among the barks, rendered
thanks to God for having preserved them from so
great a disaster; whilst the Greeks beheld with terror their
fire-ships consuming away upon the waters of the Propontis,
without having effected the least injury.</p>

<p>The irritated Latins could not pardon the perfidy and ingratitude
of the emperor Alexius: “It was not enough for
him to have failed in his engagements and broken his oaths,
he endeavoured to burn the fleet that had borne him triumphantly
to the heart of his empire: the time was now come
to repress the enterprises of traitors by the sword, and to
punish base enemies, who were acquainted with no other
arms but treachery and deceit; and, like the vilest brigands,
only ventured to deal their blows in the darkness and silence
of night.” Alexius, terrified at these threats, could think
of no other resource than that of imploring the clemency of
the Crusaders. He offered them fresh oaths and fresh promises,
and threw the blame of the hostilities upon the fury
of the people, which he had not the power to restrain. He
conjured his friends, his allies, his liberators, to come and
defend a throne ready to fall to pieces beneath him, and proposed
to give up his own palace to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>Mourzoufle was directed to convey to the Latins the supplications
and offers of the emperor, and, seizing the opportunity
to augment the alarms and discontent of the multitude,
he caused the report to be spread that he was going to deliver
Constantinople up to the barbarians of the West. On
learning this, the people assembled tumultuously in the
streets and public places; the report became general that
the enemies were already in the city, and all joined in the
cry that to prevent the greatest calamities, not a moment
was to be lost; the empire required a master who was able
to defend and protect it.</p>

<p>Whilst the young prince, seized with terror, shut himself
up in his palace, the crowd of insurgents flocked to the
church of St. Sophia to choose a new emperor.</p>

<p>Since the imperial dynasties had become the playthings
of the caprice of the multitude, and of the ambition of
conspirators, the Greeks made the changing of their sovereigns
quite a sport, without reflecting that one revolution
produces other revolutions; and, to avoid present calamities,
rushed headlong into new ones. The most prudent of the
clergy and the patricians presented themselves at the church
of St. Sophia, and earnestly endeavoured to prevent the
evils with which the country was threatened. But it was in
vain they explained to their excited auditory that by changing
their master they were sure to overthrow both the throne
and the empire. “When they asked my opinion,” says the
historian Nicetas, “I was careful not to consent to the deposition
of Isaac and Alexius, because I felt assured that
the man they would elect in their place would not be the
most able. But the people,” adds the same historian,
“whose only motive of action is passion,&mdash;the people, who
twenty years before had killed Andronicus and crowned
Isaac, could not endure their own work and live under
princes whom they themselves had chosen.” The multitude
reproached their sovereign with their misery, which was the
bitter fruit of the war; and with the weakness of their
government, which was but the result of general corruption.
The victories of the Latins, the inefficiency of the laws, the
caprices of fortune, the very will of Heaven, all were
gathered into one great accusation to be brought against
those who governed the empire. The distracted crowd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
looked to a revolution for everything; a change of emperors
appeared to them the only remedy for the ills under which
they groaned. They pressed, they solicited the patricians
and senators,&mdash;they scarcely knew the names of the men
they wished to choose as masters; but any other than Isaac,
any other than Alexius, must merit the esteem and love of
the Greeks. To be the wearer of a purple robe, was quite
enough to entitle a man to ascend the throne of Constantine.
Some excused themselves on account of age, others from
alleged incapacity. The people, sword in hand, required
them to accept the sovereign authority. At length, after
three days of stormy debate, an imprudent young man,
named Canabus, allowed himself to be prevailed upon by
the prayers and threats of the people. A phantom of an
emperor was crowned in the church of St. Sophia, and proclaimed
in Constantinople. Mourzoufle was no stranger to
this popular revolution. Several historians have thought
that he promoted the election of an obscure man, to test
the peril in some sort, and to become acquainted with the
power and will of the people, in order, one day, to profit by
it himself.</p>

<p>Alexius, made aware of this revolution, trembled in the
recesses of his deserted palace; he had no hope but in the
Latins; he solicited, by messages, the support of the barons;
he implored the pity of the marquis of Montferrat; who,
touched by his prayers, entered Constantinople by night,
and came, at the head of a chosen troop, to defend the
throne and the lives of the emperors. Mourzoufle, who
dreaded the presence of the Latins, flew to Alexius, to convince
him that they were the most dangerous enemies he
had, and told him that all would inevitably be lost if the
Franks once appeared in arms in the palace.</p>

<p>When Boniface presented himself before the palace of
Blachernæ, he found all the doors closed; Alexius caused
him to be informed that he was no longer at liberty to
receive him, and conjured him to leave Constantinople with
his soldiers. The sight of the warriors of the West had
spread terror throughout the city; their retreat revived both
the courage and fury of the people. A thousand different
rumours prevailed at once; the public places resounded with
complaints and imprecations; from moment to moment the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
crowd became more numerous and the tumult increased.
Amidst all this confusion and disorder, Mourzoufle never
lost sight of the prosecution of his designs; by promises
and caresses he won over the imperial guard, whilst his
friends pervaded the capital, exciting the fury and rage of
the multitude by their speeches and insinuations. An immense
crowd soon assembled before the palace of Blachernæ,
uttering seditious cries. Mourzoufle then presented himself
before Alexius: he employed every means to aggravate
the alarm of the young prince, and, under the pretext of
providing for his safety, drew him into a secluded apartment,
where his creatures, under his direction, loaded him
with irons and cast him into a dungeon. Coming forth, he
boldly informed the people what he had done for the salvation
of the empire; and the throne, from which he had
dragged his master, benefactor, and friend, appeared but a
just recompense for the devotedness of his services: he was
carried in triumph to the church of St. Sophia, and crowned
emperor amidst the acclamations of the people. Scarcely
was Mourzoufle clothed with the imperial purple, than he
resolved to possess the fruit of his crime in security; dreading
the caprice of both fortune and the people, he repaired
to the prison of Alexius, forced him to swallow an empoisoned
draught, and because death did not keep pace with his
impatience, strangled him with his own hands.</p>

<p>Thus perished, after a reign of six months and a few days,
the emperor Alexius, whom one revolution had placed upon
a throne, and who disappeared amidst the storms of another,
without having tasted any of the sweets of supreme rank,
and without an opportunity of proving whether he was
worthy of it. This young prince, placed in a most difficult
situation, had not the power, and perhaps not the will, to
rouse the Greeks to oppose the Crusaders. On the other
side, he had not the tact to employ the support of the Latins
so as to keep the Greeks within the bounds of obedience;
directed by perfidious counsels, ever vacillating between
patriotism and gratitude, fearing by turns to alienate his
unhappy subjects, or to irritate his formidable allies, he
perished, the victim of his own weakness and irresolution.
Isaac Angelus, on learning the tragical end of his son, died
of terror and despair; thus sparing Mourzoufle another parricide,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
of which he was not the less suspected to be guilty.
History makes no more mention of Canabus; the confusion
was so great that the Greeks were ignorant of the fate of a
man whom but a few days before they had elevated to the
rank of their sovereign; four emperors had been dragged
violently from the throne since the arrival of the Latins, and
fortune reserved the same fate for Mourzoufle.</p>

<p>In order to profit by the crime that had ministered to his
ambitious views, the murderer of Alexius formed the project
of committing another, and to bring about by treachery the
death of all the principal leaders of the army of the Crusaders.
An officer, sent to the camp of the Latins, was
directed to say that he came on the part of the emperor
Alexius, of whose death they were ignorant, to engage the
doge of Venice and the French nobles to come to the palace
of Blachernæ, where all the sums promised by the treaties,
should be placed in their hands. The barons at first agreed
to accept the invitation of the emperor, and prepared to set
out with great joy; but Dandolo, who, according to Nicetas,
deservedly obtained the name of the <i>Prudent of the Prudent</i>,
awakened their mistrust, and pointed out strong reasons
for fearing a fresh perfidy of the Greeks. It was not
long before they were fully informed of the death of Isaac,
the murder of Alexius, and all the crimes of Mourzoufle.
At this news the indignation of the Crusaders was strong
and general; knights had difficulty in crediting such baseness;
every fresh account made them tremble with horror;
they forgot the wrongs of Alexius towards themselves, deplored
his unfortunate end, and swore to avenge him. In
the council, the leaders loudly exclaimed that an implacable
war must be made against Mourzoufle, and that the nation
that had crowned treachery and parricide should be punished.
The prelates and ecclesiastics, more animated than all the
others, invoked at once the thunders of religion and earthly
war against the usurper of the imperial throne, and against
the Greeks, untrue to their sovereign, untrue to God himself.
Above all, they could not pardon the subjects of
Mourzoufle, for willingly remaining plunged in the darkness
of heresy, and escaping, by an impious revolt, from the
domination of the Holy See. They promised all the indulgences
of the sovereign pontiff and all the riches of Greece<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
to the warriors called upon to avenge the cause of God and
men.</p>

<p>Whilst the Crusaders thus breathed nothing but war
against the emperor and people of Constantinople, Mourzoufle
was preparing to repel their attacks; he earnestly
endeavoured to attach the inhabitants of the capital to his
cause; he reproached the great with their indifference and
effeminacy, and laid before them the example of the multitude;
to increase his popularity and fill his treasury, he persecuted
the courtiers of Alexius and Isaac, and confiscated
the property of all those who had enriched themselves in
public offices.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> The usurper at the same time set about
reëstablishing discipline among the troops, and augmenting
the fortifications of the city; he no longer indulged in pleasures
or allowed himself repose; as he was accused of the
greatest crimes, he had not only to contend for empire, but
for impunity; remorse doubled his activity, excited his bravery,
and proved to him that he could have no safety but in
victory. He was constantly seen parading the streets, with
his sword by his side, and an iron club in his hand, animating
the courage of the people and the soldiers.</p>

<p>The Greeks, however, contented themselves with declaiming
against the Crusaders. After having made another
attempt to burn the fleet of the Venetians, they shut themselves
up within their walls, and supported with patience
the insults and menaces of the Latins.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> The Crusaders appeared
to have nothing to fear but famine; as they began to
feel the want of provisions, Henry of Hainault, brother of
the count of Flanders, undertook, in order to obtain supplies
for the army, an expedition to the shores of the Euxine
Sea; and, followed by several knights, laid siege to Philea.
The city of Philea was the ancient Philopolis, celebrated in
the heroic ages of antiquity for the palace in which were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
received Jason and the Argonauts, who, like the French
knights, had left their country, to seek distant adventures
and perils. Henry of Hainault, after a short resistance
from the inhabitants, made himself master of the city, in
which he met with a considerable booty, and found provisions
in abundance; the latter he transported by sea to the
army.</p>

<p>Mourzoufle, being informed of this excursion, marched
out, by night, with a numerous body of troops, and placed
himself in ambush on the route which Henry of Hainault
would take on his return to the camp. The Greeks attacked
the Crusaders unexpectedly, in the full persuasion that their
victory would be an easy one; but the Frank warriors,
without displaying the least alarm, closed in their ranks, and
made so firm and good a resistance, that the ambuscaders
themselves were very quickly obliged to fly. Mourzoufle
was upon the point of falling into the hands of his enemies,
and only owed his safety to the swiftness of his horse; he
left behind on the field of battle, his buckler, his arms, and
the standard of the Virgin, which the emperors were accustomed
to have borne before them in all great perils. The
loss of this ancient and revered banner was a source of
great regret to the Greeks. The Latins, on their part,
when they saw the standard and image of the patroness of
Byzantium floating amongst their victorious ranks, were
persuaded that the mother of God had abandoned the
Greeks, and declared herself favourable to their cause.</p>

<p>After this defeat, the Greeks became convinced that
there existed no other means of safety for them but the
fortification of their capital; it was much more easy for
them to find workmen than soldiers, and a hundred thousand
men laboured day and night at the reparation of the
walls. The subjects of Mourzoufle appeared satisfied that
their ramparts would defend them, and handled the implements
of masonry without repugnance, in the hope that
they would prevent the necessity for their wielding the
sword or lance.</p>

<p>Mourzoufle had learnt to dread the courage of his enemies,
and as strongly doubted the valour of his subjects;
therefore, before risking any fresh warlike attempts, he
determined to sue for peace, and demanded an interview<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
with the leaders of the Crusaders. The lords and barons
refused with horror to have an interview with the usurper
of the throne, the murderer, the executioner of Alexius; but
the love of peace, and the cause of humanity, induced the
doge of Venice to consent to listen to the proposals of
Mourzoufle. Henry Dandolo repaired in his galley to the
point of the gulf, and the usurper, mounted on horseback,
approached him as near as possible. The conference was
long and animated. The doge required Mourzoufle to pay
immediately five thousand pounds’ weight of gold, to aid the
Crusaders in their expedition to Syria, and again to swear
obedience to the Romish church. After a long altercation,
Mourzoufle promised to give the Latins the money and
assistance they demanded; but he could not consent to
submit to the yoke of the Church of Rome.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> The doge,
astonished that, after having outraged all the laws of Heaven
and nature, he should attach so much importance to religious
opinions, casting a glance of contempt at Mourzoufle,
asked him, if the Greek religion excused treachery and
parricide?<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> The usurper, although much irritated, dissembled
his anger, and was endeavouring to justify his conduct,
when the conference was interrupted by some Latin
horsemen.</p>

<p>Mourzoufle, on his return to Constantinople, convinced
that he must prepare for war, set earnestly about his task,
and determined to die with arms in his hand. By his
orders, the walls and towers that defended the city on the
side of the port, were elevated many feet. He constructed
upon the walls galleries of several stages, from which the
soldiers might launch arrows and javelins, and employ
balistas and other machines of war; at the top of each
tower was placed a drawbridge, which, when lowered upon
the vessels, might afford the besieged a means of pursuing
their enemies, even to their own fleet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>The Crusaders, although supported by their natural
bravery, could not view all these preparations with indifference.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
The most intrepid could not help feeling some
inquietude on comparing the small number of the Franks
with the imperial army and the population of Constantinople;
all the resources they had till that time found in
their alliance with the emperors were about to fail them,
without their having any hope of supplying their place but
by some miraculous victory: for they had no succour to
look for from the West. Every day war became more
dangerous, and peace more difficult; the time was gone by
for retreat. In this situation, such were the spirit and
character of the heroes of this crusade, that they drew fresh
strength from the very circumstances that would appear
likely to have depressed them, and filled them with dread;
the greater the danger, the more courage and firmness they
displayed; menaced on all sides, expecting to meet with no
asylum on either sea or land, there remained no other part
to take but that of besieging a city from which they could
not retire with safety: thus nothing could overcome their
invincible bravery.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>On viewing the towers that the Greeks considered as a
certain means of safety, the leaders assembled in their
camp, and shared amongst them the spoils of the empire
and the capital, of which they entertained no doubt of
achieving the conquest. It was decided in the council of the
princes, barons, and knights, that a new emperor should be
nominated instead of Mourzoufle, and that this emperor
should be chosen from the victorious army of the Latins.
The chief of the new empire should possess by right a
fourth of the conquest, with the two palaces of Blachernæ
and Bucoleon. The cities and lands of the empire, as well
as the booty they should obtain in the capital, were to be
distributed among the Franks and Venetians, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
condition of rendering homage to the emperor. In the same
council regulations were made to assign the proportions of
the Latin clergy, and of the lords and barons. They regulated,
according to the feudal laws, the rights and duties of
the emperors and subjects, of the great and small vassals.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
Thus Constantinople, under the dominion of the Greeks,
beheld before its walls a small band of warriors, who, helm
on head, and sword in hand, abolished in her walls the
legislation of Greece, and imposed upon her beforehand the
laws of the West. By this act of legislation, which they
derived from Europe, the knights and barons appeared to
take possession of the empire; and, whilst making war
against the inhabitants of Constantinople, might imagine
that they were already fighting for the safety and glory of
their own country.</p>

<p>In the first siege of Byzantium, the French had been
desirous of attacking the city by land, but experience had
taught them to appreciate properly the wiser counsels of
the Venetians. They determined, with an unanimous voice,
to direct all their efforts to an attack by sea. They conveyed
into the vessels the arms, provisions, and appointments
of all kinds; and the whole army embarked on
Thursday, the 8th day of April, 1204. On the morrow,
with the first rays of the sun, the fleet which bore the
knights and their horses, the pilgrims and all they possessed,
the tents, the machines of the Crusaders, <i>and the destinies
of a great empire</i>, heaved anchor, and crossed the breadth of
the gulf. The ships and galleys, arranged in line, covered
the sea for the space of half a league. The sight of the
towers and ramparts, bristling with arms and soldiers, and
covered with murderous machines and long tubes of brass,
from which poured the Greek fire, did not in the least
intimidate the warriors of the West. The Greeks had
trembled with fright at seeing the fleet of the Crusaders in
motion; but as they could look for no safety but in resistance,
they appeared disposed to brave all perils in defence of
their property and their families.</p>

<p>Mourzoufle had pitched his tents in the part of the city
ravaged by the fire; his army was encamped amidst ruins,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
and his soldiers had nothing beneath their eyes but melancholy
pictures, the sight of which he thought must necessarily
excite them to vengeance. From the summit of one
of the seven hills, the emperor was able to view the contest,
to send succours where he saw they were wanted, and to reanimate
at every moment the courage of those who defended
the walls and towers.</p>

<p>At the first signal, the Greeks put all their machines in
full operation, and endeavoured to defend the approach to
the ramparts; but several ships soon gained the shore; the
ladders are planted, and the walls shake beneath the continuous
blows of the rams. The attack and defence proceed
with equal fury. The Greeks fight with advantage from
the tops of their elevated towers; the Crusaders, everywhere
overpowered by numbers, cannot open themselves a passage,
and find death at the foot of the ramparts they burn
to surmount. The ardour for fight, itself, produced disorder
among the assailants, and confusion in their fleet.
The Latins faced all perils, and sustained the impetuous
shock of the Greeks till the third hour of the evening: “It
was then,” says the marshal of Champagne, “that fortune and
our sins decreed that we should be repulsed.” The leaders,
dreading the destruction of their fleet and army, ordered
the retreat to be sounded. When the Greeks saw the
Crusaders drawing off, they believed that their capital was
saved; the people of Byzantium flocked to the churches to
return thanks to Heaven for so great a victory, and, by the
excess of their transports, proved how great the fear had
been with which the Latins had inspired them.</p>

<p>On the evening of the same day, the doge and barons
assembled in a church near the sea, to deliberate upon their
future proceedings; they spoke with deep grief of the check
they had sustained, and expatiated strongly upon the necessity
of promptly retrieving their defeat.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> “The Crusaders
were still the same men that had already surmounted the
ramparts of Byzantium; the Greeks were still the same
frivolous, pusillanimous nation, that could oppose no other
arms but those of cunning to those of valour. The soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
of Mourzoufle had been able to resist for one day; but they
would soon remember that the Latins had conquered them
many times; the recollections of the past were sufficient to
revive the confidence of the one party, and to fill the others
with terror. Besides, it was well known that the Greeks
only contended for the triumph of usurpation and parricide;
whilst the Crusaders fought for the triumph of humanity
and justice. God would recognise his true servants, and
would protect his own cause.”</p>

<p>These discourses could not reassure all the Crusaders,
and many proposed to change the point of attack, and make
a new assault on the side of the Propontis. The Venetians
did not agree with this opinion, and dreaded lest the fleet
should be drawn away by the currents of the sea. Some of
the leaders despaired of the success of the enterprise; and,
in their despair, would have been very willing, says an eyewitness,
“that the winds and the waves should carry them away
beyond the Archipelago.”<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> The advice of the Venetians was,
however, adopted; and the council decided that the attack
upon Constantinople should be renewed on the same side,
and at the same point at which the army had been repulsed.
Two days were employed in repairing the vessels and
machines; and on the third day, the 12th of April, the
trumpets once more sounded the signal for battle. The
fleet got into motion, and advanced in good order towards
the ramparts of Constantinople. The Greeks, who were
still rejoicing over their first advantage, could scarcely
believe the approach of the Latins to be reality, and their
surprise was by no means free from terror. On the other
side, the Crusaders, who had met with a resistance they had
not at all expected, advanced with precaution towards the
ramparts, at the foot of which they had fought in vain. To
inflame the ardour and emulation of the soldiers, the leaders
of the Latins had proclaimed, by a herald-at-arms, that he
that should plant the first banner of the cross upon a tower
of the city, should receive a hundred and fifty silver marks.</p>

<p>The combat soon commenced, and was as quickly general;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
the defence was no less vigorous than the attack: beams,
stones, javelins were hurled from one side to the other,
crossed or met in mid-air, and fell with a loud noise on the
ramparts and the ships; the whole shore resounded with the
cries of the combatants and the clashing of swords and
lances. In the fleet, the vessels were joined together, and
proceeded two by two, in order that upon each point of
attack, the number of the assailants might correspond with
that of the besieged. The drawbridges are soon let down,
and are covered with intrepid warriors, who threaten the invasion
of the most lofty towers. The soldiers mount in file,
and gain the battlements; the opponents seek, attack, and
repulse each other in a thousand different places. Some, on
the point of seizing victory, are overthrown by a mass of
stone: others are consumed by the Greek fire; but they who
are repulsed, again return to the charge, and the leaders
everywhere set an example by mounting to the assault like
common soldiers.</p>

<p>The sun had run half his course, and prodigies of valour
had not been able to triumph over the resistance of the besieged,
when a strong breeze from the north arose, and
brought two ships that fought together close under the walls.
The bishop of Troie and the bishop of Soissons were on
board of these two vessels, called the <i>Pilgrim</i> and the
<i>Paradise</i>. Scarcely were the drawbridges lowered, than
two Frank warriors were seen upon one of the towers of
the city. These two warriors, one of whom was a Frenchman,
named D’Urboise, and the other a Venetian, Pietro
Alberti, drew after them a crowd of their companions, and
the Greeks were massacred or took to flight. In the confusion
of the <i>mêlée</i>, the brave Alberti was slain by a Frenchman,
who mistook him for a Greek, and who, on discovering
his mistake, attempted to kill himself in despair. The Crusaders,
excited by the fight, scarcely perceived this sad and
tragical scene, but pursued the flying, disordered enemy.</p>

<p>The banners of the bishops of Troie and Soissons were
planted on the top of the towers, and attracted the eager
eyes of the whole army. This sight inflames those who are
still on board the vessels; on all sides they press, they rush
forward, they fly to the escalade. The Franks obtain
possession of four towers: terror prevails among the Greeks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
and the few who resist are slaughtered at every point they
endeavour to defend; three of the gates of the city fall to
pieces beneath the strokes of the rams; the horsemen issue
from the ships with their horses, and the whole army of the
Crusaders precipitates itself at once into the city.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> A
horseman (Pierre Bacheux), who preceded his fellows, advanced
almost alone to the hill upon which Mourzoufle was
encamped, and the Greeks, in their fright, took him for a
giant. Nicetas himself says that his helmet appeared as
large as a tower; the soldiers of the emperor could not
stand against the appearance of a single Frank horseman.
Mourzoufle, abandoned by his troops, fled: the Crusaders
took possession of the imperial tents, continued their victorious
course into the city, and put to the sword every
Greek they met with. “<i>It was a horrible spectacle</i>,” says
Villehardouin, “<i>to see women and young children running
distractedly here and there, trembling and half dead with
fright, lamenting piteously, and begging for mercy.</i>”</p>

<p>The Crusaders set fire to the quarter they had invaded,<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
and the flames, driven by the wind, announced to the other
extremities of the city the presence of an irritated conqueror.
Terror and despair prevailed in every street of Constantinople.
Some Greek soldiers retired to the palace, whilst
others, to escape recognition, threw away both their clothes
and their arms. The people and the clergy took refuge
in the churches, and the more wealthy inhabitants, in all
parts, endeavoured to conceal their most valuable property
by burying it in the earth. Many rushed out of the city,
without at all knowing whither to direct their steps.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>Whilst all were flying before them, the Crusaders were
in a state of astonishment at their own victory. At the
approach of night, they dreaded an ambuscade, and did not
venture to pursue the conquered enemy further; the Venetians
encamped within sight of their vessels; the count of
Flanders, by a happy augury, occupied the imperial tents,
and the marquis of Montferrat advanced towards the palace
of Blachernæ. The Latins entertained no idea that the
conflict was ended, and kept careful watch under the ramparts
they had invaded and won.</p>

<p>Mourzoufle went through many quarters of the city, endeavouring
to rally the soldiers: he spoke to them of glory,
he invoked the name of their country, he promised rich rewards
for valour: but the voice of patriotism was no longer
listened to, and neither the love of glory nor the hopes of
reward could affect men whose whole thoughts were engaged
in the means of saving their lives. Mourzoufle no longer
inspired either respect or confidence, and the people, in
reply to his exhortations, reproached him with his parricide,
and attributed to him all the calamities of the war. When
he found himself without hope, it became necessary to endeavour
to escape both the pursuit of the conquerors and
the resentment of the conquered, and he embarked secretly
on the Propontis, with the purpose of seeking an army, or
rather an asylum, in the mountains of Thrace. When his
flight became known in Constantinople, his name was loaded
with maledictions, and, as if it was necessary that an emperor
should be present at the fall of the empire, a distracted
crowd flocked to the church of St. Sophia, to choose a new
master.</p>

<p>Theodore Ducas and Theodore Lascaris solicited the
suffrages of the assembly, and contended for a throne that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
no longer existed. Lascaris was chosen emperor, but he did
not dare to assume the imperial crown. This prince possessed
both firmness and spirit; the Greeks even boasted
of his skill in war, and he undertook to reanimate their
courage and arouse their patriotism. “The Latins,” said
he, “are few, and advance with trembling caution into a city
that has still numberless defenders; the Crusaders are afraid
to leave their ships at any distance, as they know they are
their only refuge in case of defeat: pressed by the approach
of danger, they have called in the assistance of fire as their
faithful auxiliary, and conceal their fears behind a rampart
of flames and a heap of ruins. The warriors of the West
neither fight for religion, nor their country, nor their property,
nor the honour of their families. The Greeks, on
the contrary, defend all they hold most dear, and must carry
to the contest every sentiment that can increase the courage
and inflame the zeal of citizens. If you are still Romans,”
added Lascaris, “the victory is easy; twenty thousand barbarians
have shut themselves up within your walls; fortune
has given them up to our arms.” The new emperor then
addressed the soldiers and the imperial guards; he represented
to them that their safety was inseparably connected
with that of Constantinople, that the enemy would never
pardon being driven back by them several times from the
ramparts of the capital; that in victory they would find all
the advantages of fortune, all the pleasures of life: whilst
in flight, neither land nor sea could afford them an asylum,
and that shame, misery, and death itself would follow their
footsteps everywhere. Lascaris did not neglect to flatter
the pride, and endeavour to kindle the zeal of the patricians.
He reminded them of the heroes of ancient Rome, and presented
to their valour the great examples of history. “It
was to their arms Providence had confided the safety of the
imperial city; if, contrary to all hopes, the country should
be subdued, they could have but few regrets in abandoning
life, and would find perhaps some glory in dying on the
same day on which the old empire of the Cæsars should be
doomed to fall.”</p>

<p>The soldiers only replied to his speech by demanding their
pay; the people listened to Lascaris with more surprise than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
confidence, and the patricians preserved a gloomy silence,
sensible to no other feeling but a profound despair. The
trumpets of the Crusaders were soon heard, and at this
signal, terror seized even the bravest; there was no longer
any idea of disputing the victory with the Latins. Lascaris,
left alone, was himself obliged to abandon a city which he
could find no one to assist him in defending. Thus Constantinople,
that had beheld two emperors in one night, was
once again without a master, and presented the image of a
vessel without a rudder, dashed about by the winds, and
ready to perish amidst the howling of the tempest. The
conflagration begun by the Latins, extended to several other
quarters, and consumed, by the admission of the barons,
more houses than three of the greatest cities of either
France or Germany contained. The fire continued its
ravages during the whole night, and before day the Crusaders
prepared, by the light of its flames, to follow up their
victory. Ranged in order of battle, they were advancing
with precaution and mistrust, when their ears were saluted
with supplicating voices that filled the air with lamentations
and prayers. Women, children, and old men, preceded by
the clergy, bearing crosses and images of saints, came in
procession, to throw themselves at the feet of the conquerors.
The leaders allowed their hearts to be touched by the cries
and entreaties of this weeping crowd, and a herald-at-arms
was ordered to pass through the ranks, and proclaim the
laws of clemency; the soldiers were commanded to spare
the lives of the inhabitants, and to respect the honour of
women and maidens. The Latin clergy joined their exhortations
with those of the leaders of the army, and threatened
with the vengeance of the Church all who should abuse victory
by outraging humanity.</p>

<p>In the mean time the Crusaders advanced amidst the
braying of trumpets and the noise of clarions, and their
banners were soon planted in the principal quarters of the
city. When Boniface entered the palace of Bucoleon,
which was supposed to be occupied by the imperial guard,
he was surprised to find a great number of women, of the
first families of the empire, whose only defence was their
groans and tears. Marguerite, daughter of the king of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Hungary, and wife of Isaac, and Agnes, daughter of a king
of France,<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> the wife of two emperors, threw themselves at
the feet of the barons, and implored their mercy. The
marquis of Montferrat respected their misfortunes, and
placed them under the protection of a guard. Whilst
Boniface occupied the palace of Bucoleon, Henry of Hainault
took possession of that of Blachernæ; these two
palaces, filled with immense riches, were preserved from
pillage, and were exempted from the lamentable scenes
which, during several days, desolated the city of Constantinople.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>The Crusaders, impatient to gather the treasures they
had shared beforehand, spread themselves through all the
quarters of the capital, and carried off, without pity or consideration,
everything that offered itself to their avidity.
The houses of the poorest citizens were no more respected
than the mansions of the rich. The Greeks, plundered of
their property, ill-treated by the conquerors, and turned out
of their homes, implored the humanity of the counts and
barons, and pressed around the marquis of Montferrat, crying,
“<i>Holy king marquis, have pity upon us!</i>” Boniface was
touched by their prayers, and endeavoured to recall the Crusaders
to some sentiments of moderation; but the license of
the soldiers increased with the sight of booty; the most dissolute
and most undisciplined gave the signal, and marched at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
their head, and their example led on all the rest: the intoxication
of victory had no longer any restraint,&mdash;it was
sensible to neither fear nor pity.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>When the Crusaders discontinued the slaughter, they had
recourse to every kind of outrage and violence to plunder
the conquered; no spot in Constantinople was free from
brutal search. In spite of the frequently-repeated prohibitions
of their leaders and priests, they respected neither the
modesty of women nor the sanctity of churches. Some
soldiers and followers of the army plundered the tombs and
coffins of the emperors; the body of Justinian, which ages
had spared, and which presented itself to their eyes in a
fresh and undecayed state, could not repel their sacrilegious
hands, or make them respect the peace of the grave; in
every temple where a rag of silk shone, or a particle of gold
glittered, their greedy fingers were stretched out to clutch
them. The altar of the Virgin, which decorated the church of
St. Sophia, and which was admired as a masterpiece of art, was
beaten to pieces, and the veil of the sanctuary was torn to
rags. The conquerors played at dice upon the marble tables
which represented the apostles, and got drunk out of the
cups reserved for divine service. Horses and mules led into
the sanctuary, bent beneath the weight of the spoils, and,
pierced by sword-points, stained with their blood and their
ordure the vestibule of St. Sophia. A prostitute girl, whom
Nicetas calls the follower of demons, the priestess of furies,
mounted the patriarchal pulpit, sang an immodest song, and
danced in the church, amidst a crowd of soldiers, as if to
insult the ceremonies of religion.</p>

<p>The Greeks could not behold these impious scenes without
trembling with horror. Nicetas, whilst deploring the misfortunes
of the empire and the Greek Church, declaims
with vehemence against the barbarous race of the Franks.
“Here,” says he, “is what was promised by that golden
gorget, that haughty bearing, those elevated eyebrows, that
closely shaven beard, that hand so ready to shed blood, those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
nostrils breathing anger, that proud eye, that cruel disposition,
that prompt and hurried utterance.”<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> The historian
of Byzantium reproaches the Crusaders with having surpassed
the Saracens in barbarity, and reminds them of the
example of the soldiers of Saladin, who, when masters of
Jerusalem, neither violated the modesty of matrons and
virgins, nor filled the sepulchre of the Saviour with bloody
carcasses, nor subjected Christians to fire, sword, hunger, or
nakedness.</p>

<p>The country on the shores of the Bosphorus offered a no
less deplorable spectacle than the capital. Villages, churches,
country-houses were all devastated and given over to pillage.
A distracted crowd covered the roads, and wandered about
at hazard, pursued by fear, bending under fatigue, and
uttering cries of despair. Senators, patricians, the offspring
of a family of emperors, strayed homeless about, covered
with rags, seeking for any miserable asylum. When the
church of St. Sophia was pillaged, the patriarch fled away,
imploring the charity of passengers; all the rich fell into
indigence, and inspired nothing but contempt; the most
illustrious nobility, the highest dignities, the splendour of
talents or virtues, possessed nothing to create respect or
attract admiration. Misery, like inevitable death, effaced
all distinctions, and confounded all ranks; the dregs of the
people completed the spoliation of the fugitives, at the same
time insulting their misfortunes. A senseless multitude
rejoiced at the public evils, applauded the degradation of the
noble and the rich, and called these disastrous days, days of
justice and equality.</p>

<p>Nicetas describes his misfortune and his own deplorable
adventures; the house he had inhabited under the reign of
the emperors was consumed by the flames of the second
conflagration: having retired with his family to another
house, built near the church of St. Sophia, he soon found
himself in danger in this last asylum, and only owed his
safety to devoted friendship and gratitude. A Venetian
merchant, whom he had saved from the fury of the Greeks
before the flight of Alexius, was desirous, in his turn, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
saving his benefactor; he armed himself with a sword and a
lance, assumed the dress of a soldier of the cross, and as he
spoke the languages of the West, he defended the entrance
of the house of Nicetas, saying it was his, the price of his
blood, shed in fight. This vigilant sentinel at first repulsed
all aggressors, and braved a thousand perils; a model of
fidelity and virtue, amidst the horrid disorders that desolated
Constantinople.</p>

<p>The turbulent crowd of soldiers that filled the streets and
penetrated everywhere, became indignant that a single house
should be thus exempt from their brutal searches. The
despairing Venetian at length came to Nicetas, and told him
that it was totally out of his power to defend him any longer.
“If you remain here,” said he, “to-morrow, perhaps, you
will be loaded with chains, and your family become a prey
to all the violences of the conquerors. Follow me, and I
will conduct you out of the gates of Constantinople.”
Nicetas, with his wife and children, followed the faithful
Venetian: their liberator, in armour, marched at their head,
and led them as if they were prisoners.</p>

<p>This unfortunate family proceeded, filled with fear, meeting
at every step soldiers greedy of pillage, who ill-treated the
Greeks they plundered, and threatened every woman with
insult. Nicetas, and some of his friends who had come to
join him, carried their children in their arms, the only wealth
that Heaven had left them; and defended alone by the pity
which their despair and misery inspired. They walked
together, placing their wives and daughters in the centre,
after having advised the youngest to blacken their faces
with earth. In spite of this precaution, the beauty of one
young girl attracted the attention of a soldier, and she was
borne away from the arms of her father, weighed down by
age and infirmities. Nicetas, touched by the tears of the
old man, flew after the ravisher, and addressing himself to
all the warriors he met, he implored their pity, and conjured
them, in the name of Heaven, the protector of virtue, in the
name of their own families, to snatch a daughter from dishonour,
to save a father from despair. The Frank warriors
were affected by his prayer, and the unfortunate father
soon saw his daughter restored to him, the only hope of
his exile, the last consolation of his grey hairs. Nicetas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
and his companions in trouble encountered still further dangers,
but at length got safely out of Constantinople by the
Golden Gate, happy at being able to quit a country so lately
the object of all their affections. The generous Venetian
received their blessings, and in return prayed Heaven to
protect them in their exile.</p>

<p>Nicetas, with tears, embraced his liberator, whom he never
had the good fortune to see again; then casting a look upon
Constantinople, upon his unhappy country, he addressed
to it these touching complaints, which express the griefs of
his exile, and which he himself has transmitted to us:<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>&mdash;“O
Queen of Cities, what power has been able to separate
us from thee! What consolation shall we find on issuing
from thy walls, as naked as we issued from the bosom of our
mothers! Become the sport of strangers, the companions
of wild animals that inhabit the forests, we shall never again
visit thy august domes, and can only fly with terror around
thee, like sparrows round the spot where their nest has been
destroyed.”</p>

<p>Nicetas arrived with his family at Cylindria, and afterwards
retired to Nice, where he employed himself in retracing
the history of the misfortunes of his country.</p>

<p>Constantinople did not cease to be the theatre of the
frightful deeds of violence that war brings in its train.
Amidst the sanguinary sports of victory, the Latins, to
insult the effeminate manners of the Greeks, clothed themselves
in long flowing robes, painted of various colours; they
fastened to the heads of their horses linen hoods with their
silken cords, in which the Orientals dress themselves; whilst
others paraded the streets carrying in their hands, instead of
a sword, some paper and an ink-horn; thus ridiculing the
conquered, whom they termed scribes and copyers.</p>

<p>The Greeks had on all occasions insulted the ignorance of
the Latins; the knights, without seeking to retort upon
the quiet occupations of peace. With these dispositions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
it was not likely they should spare the monuments that
decorated the public places, the palaces, or the edifices of
Byzantium. Constantinople, which to this period had
stood erect amidst the ruins of several empires, had collected
within its walls the scattered relics of the arts, and
was proud to exhibit the masterpieces that had been saved
from the destruction of barbarous ages. The bronze, in
which breathed the genius of antiquity, was cast into the
furnace, and converted into money, to satisfy the greedy
soldiers. The heroes and gods of the Nile, those of ancient
Greece and of ancient Rome, the masterpieces of Praxiteles,
Phidias, and the most celebrated artists, fell beneath the
strokes of the conquerors.</p>

<p>Nicetas, who deplores the loss of these monuments, has
left us a description, from which the history of art may derive
some advantage.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> The historian of Byzantium informs us
that in the Place of Constantine stood, before the siege, the
statue of Juno, and that of Paris offering to Venus the
prize of beauty, or the apple of discord. The statue of Juno,
which had formerly adorned the temple of the goddess at
Samos, was of so colossal a size, that when it was destroyed
by the Crusaders, eight harnessed oxen were required to
drag the gigantic head to the palace of Bucoleon. In the
same place was erected an obelisk of a square form, which
astonished the spectator by the multitude and variety of the
objects it presented to his view. On the sides of this obelisk
the artist had represented, in basso-relievo, all sorts of birds
saluting the return of the sun, villagers employed in their
rustic labours, shepherds playing on their pipes, sheep
bleating, lambs bounding on the grass; further on, a tranquil
sea and fishes of a thousand sorts, some taken alive,
others breaking the nets and regaining their deep retreats;
at the back of the landscape, naked cupids playing and
throwing apples at each other; at the top of the obelisk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
which terminated in a pyramidal form, was the figure of a
woman that turned with the least breath of air, which was
called <i>the attendant of the winds</i>.</p>

<p>An equestrian statue<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> ornamented the place of Mount
Taurus; the horse appeared to throw up the dust with his
feet, and outspeed the winds in his course. As the horseman
had his arm extended towards the sun, some supposed
it to represent Joshua, commanding the star of day to stand
still, on the plains of Gabaon; others believed the artist
meant to describe Bellerophon mounted on Pegasus.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>A colossal statue of Hercules,<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> attributed to Lysippus,
was one of the ornaments of the Hippodrome; the demigod
had neither his bow nor his club; he was seated on a bed of
osier;<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> his left knee bent, sustained his elbow; his head
reclining on his left hand; his pensive looks and air expressing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
the vexation and sorrow caused by the jealousy of
Eurystheus. The shoulders and chest of Hercules were
broad, his hair was curled, and his limbs were large and
muscular; his leg alone exceeded in height the stature of an
ordinary man. The skin of the Nemean lion, exhibited over
the shoulders of the son of Alemena, the erected mane and
the head of the animal, which might be fancied still to roar
and terrify the passers by, who stopped to contemplate the
statue.</p>

<p>Not far from the terrible Hercules, was a group of an ass
and its driver, which Augustus placed in his colony of Nicopolis,
to perpetuate the remembrance of a singular circumstance
that had foretold the victory of Actium to him.
Near this were the hyena or she-wolf that suckled Romulus
and Remus, a monument from the old nations of the West;<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
the sphinx, with the face of a woman, dragging frightful
animals behind her; the crocodile, an inhabitant of the Nile,
with his tail covered with horrible scales; a man fighting
with a lion; an elephant with his supple trunk; and the
antique Scylla, showing before, the features of a woman, with
large breasts and a deformed figure; and behind, such
monsters as those that pursued Ulysses and his companions.
In the same place was an eagle clutching a serpent in his
talons, and bearing it away towards the azure vault; the
bronze beautifully exhibited the pain of the reptile, and the
haughty fierceness of the bird of Jupiter. When the sun
shone on the horizon, the extended wings of the king of the
air denoted, by lines skilfully traced, the twelve hours of the
day.</p>

<p>All who, in that gross age, preserved any taste for the
arts, admired the figure of a young woman, her hair plaited
on her brow, and gathered into a knot behind, placed upon
a column of the Circus; this young woman, as if by enchantment,
bore in her right hand a horseman, whose horse she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
held by one foot; the horseman covered with his cuirass, and
the spirited, neighing steed, seemed listening to the warlike
trumpet, and to breathe nothing but eagerness for the fight.
Near the eastern boundary of the Circus were represented in
bronze, the charioteers who had gained prizes, and whose
triumphs, in times gone by, had often divided the empire
into two factions; they appeared standing in their chariots,
running in the lists, pulling and loosening by turns the reins
of their coursers, and encouraging them by gesture and voice.
Not far from this, upon a basis of stone, were several
Egyptian animals, the aspic, the basilisk, and the crocodile,
all engaged in mortal combat,&mdash;an image of the war made by
the wicked on each other; the hideous forms of these
animals, the rage and pain expressed throughout their bodies,
the livid poison which seemed to exhale with their bites,
altogether inspired a feeling of disgust and terror. Another
masterpiece, made to charm the sight, ought, at least, to
have touched and disarmed the conquerors. Among the
statues described by Nicetas, none is more conspicuous than
a Helen with her charming smile and her voluptuous attitude;
a Helen, with perfect regularity of features, her hair
floating at the pleasure of the winds, her eyes full of languor,
her lips, which even in the bronze were rosy; her arms, of
which even the same bronze showed the whiteness; Helen,
in short, with all her beauty, and such as she appeared before
the old men of Ilium, who were ravished at her presence.</p>

<p>Constantinople contained many other splendid objects
of art, which preceding ages had admired; almost all such
as were of bronze were condemned to perish, the Crusaders
seeing in these monuments nothing but the metal of which
they were composed. “That which antiquity had judged,”
says Nicetas, “of inestimable value, became, all at once, a
common matter; and that which had cost immense sums,
was changed by the Latins into pieces of coin of very little
value!” The statues of marble held out less temptation for
the cupidity of the conquerors, and received no other injuries
than such as were inseparable from the tumult and disorders
of war.</p>

<p>The Greeks, who appeared so proud of their knowledge,
themselves neglected the fine arts. The sciences of Greece,
the profane wisdom of the Academy and the Lyceum, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
given place among them to the debates of scholastic theology,
they passed by the Hippodrome with indifference, and held
nothing in reverence but relics and images of saints. These
religious treasures, preserved with care in the churches and
palaces of Byzantium, had, during several ages, attracted the
attention of the Christian world; in the days that followed
the conquest, they tempted the pious cupidity of the Crusaders.
Whilst the greater part of the warriors bore away
the gold, the jewels, the carpets, and the rich stuffs of the
East, the more devout of the pilgrims, particularly the
ecclesiastics, collected a booty much more innocent and
appropriate to the soldiers of Christ. Many braved the
prohibitions of their leaders and their superiors, and did not
disdain to employ by turns supplications and menaces,
stratagem or violence, to procure relics that were the objects
of their respect and veneration. Contemporary history
relates several examples of this, which serve to make us
acquainted with the spirit of the pilgrim conquerors of
Byzantium. Martin Litz, abbot of Paris, in the diocese of
Bâle, entered into a church that had been given up to pillage,
and penetrated, without being observed, into a retired place,
where numerous relics were deposited, under the guardianship
of a Greek monk.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> This Greek monk was then at
prayers, with his hands raised supplicatingly towards
heaven. His old age, his white hairs, his fervent piety, and
the grief impressed upon his brow, were calculated to inspire
both respect and pity; but Martin, approaching the venerable
guardian of the treasures with an angry manner,
exclaimed in a threatening tone, “Miserable old man, if thou
dost not instantly conduct me to the place where thy relics
are hidden, prepare to die on the spot!” The monk, terrified
by this menace, immediately and tremblingly arose, and
pointed to a large iron coffer, into which the pious abbot
eagerly plunged both his hands, and seized everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
precious that he could grasp. Delighted with this conquest,
he ran to conceal his treasures on board a vessel, and contrived,
by a holy fraud, to keep them for several days from
the knowledge of the leaders and prelates of the army, who
had strictly ordered the pilgrims to bring to an appointed
place all the relics that fell into their hands.</p>

<p>Martin Litz, at first, returned to the Christians of Palestine,
who had sent him to Constantinople; and, a short time
after, came back to Europe, loaded with spoils obtained from
the clergy of Byzantium. Among the relics he exhibited on
his return, were, a piece of the true cross, the bones of
St. John the Baptist, and an arm of St. James. The miraculous
translation of this treasure is celebrated with much
pomp by the monk Gunther, in whom it created more
surprise and joy than the conquest of a great empire. If we
may credit the account of the German monk, angels descended
from heaven to watch over the relics of Martin
Litz. On the route of the holy abbot, the tempests of the
ocean were silent, pirates were struck motionless, and
robbers, those pests of travellers, stopped short, seized with
respect and fear. At length Martin Litz was received in
triumph at Bâle, and the treasures he had preserved through
so many perils, were distributed among the principal
churches of the diocese.</p>

<p>Another priest, named Galon de Dampierre, of the diocese
of Langres, less adroit or less fortunate than Martin Litz,
had not been able to obtain any share of the spoils of the
churches; he went and threw himself at the feet of the
pope’s legate, and implored him, with tears in his eyes, to
permit him to carry back to his country the head of St. Mames.
A third ecclesiastic of Picardy, having found the head of
St. George, and the head of St. John the Baptist, concealed
among the ruins, hastened to quit Constantinople, and, laden
with such a rich prize, presented to the cathedral of Amiens,
his country, the inestimable relics of which Providence had
made him the possessor.</p>

<p>The princes and barons did not despise these holy spoils.
Dandolo, receiving as his share<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> a piece of the true cross,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
which the emperor Constantine was accustomed to have
borne before him to battle, made a present of it to the
republic of Venice. Baldwin kept for himself the crown of
thorns of Christ, and several other relics found in the palace
of Bucoleon. He sent Philip Augustus, king of France, a
portion of the true cross, a foot in length; some of the hair
of Jesus Christ, when an infant; and the linen in which the
Man-God was enveloped in the stable in which he was
born.</p>

<p>The Greek priests and monks, thus plundered by the conquerors,
parted with tears from the remains of the saints
that had been confided to their keeping, and which every
day cured the sick, made the lame to walk, restored sight to
the blind, and strength to the paralytic. These holy spoils,
that the devotion of the faithful had gathered together from
all the countries of the East, went to illustrate the churches
of France and Italy, and were received by the Christians of
the West as the most glorious trophies of the victories
God had enabled the Crusaders to obtain.</p>

<p>Constantinople fell into the power of the Latins on the
10th of April, towards the end of Lent. The marshal of
Champagne, after relating some of the scenes we have
described, says with great simplicity, “Thus passed the
splendid festivities of Easter.” The clergy called the Crusaders
to penitence; the voice of religion made itself heard
in hearts hardened by victory; the soldiers crowded to the
churches they had devastated, and celebrated the sufferings
and death of Christ upon the wrecks of his own altars.</p>

<p>This solemn epoch without doubt inspired some generous
sentiments; all the Latins were not deaf to the language of
the charity of the Gospel. We feel bound here to admit
that the greater part of the knights and ecclesiastics protected
the liberty and lives of the citizens, and the honour
of matrons and virgins; but such was the spirit that then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
possessed the warriors, that all the Crusaders allowed themselves
to be overcome by the thirst for booty; and the
leaders, equally with the soldiers, exercised, without hesitation
or scruple, the right which their victory had given
them of plundering the conquered. It was agreed that
all the spoils should be deposited in three churches,
selected for the purpose; and the leaders commanded the
Crusaders to bring, in common, the whole of the booty, and
threatened with death and excommunication all who should
abstract anything from the prize of the valour, and the
recompense due to the labours of the whole army. Many
soldiers, and even some knights, allowed themselves to be
led away by avarice, and retained valuable objects that fell
into their hands. “Which,” says the marshal of Champagne,
“made the Lord to begin to love them less.” The
justice of the counts and barons was inflexible towards the
guilty; the count of St. Pol ordered one of his knights, who
had withheld something from the common stock of booty, to
be hung, with his escutcheon suspended from his neck.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
Thus the Greeks, plundered by violence, might be present
at the punishment of some of the ravishers of their property,
and might contemplate with surprise the regulations
of stern equity mingled with the disorders of victory and
pillage. After the festival of Easter, the Crusaders shared
the captured riches; the fourth part of the spoil was set
aside for him who should be chosen emperor, and the rest
was divided among the French and the Venetians. The
French Crusaders, who had conquered Zara, to the sole
advantage of the Venetians, were not the less called upon
to pay the fifty thousand silver marks they owed to the
republic; the amount was deducted beforehand from the
portion of the booty that belonged to them. In the division
that was made among the warriors of Lombardy, Germany,
and France, each knight had a part equal to that of two
horsemen, and every horseman one equal to that of two
foot-soldiers. All the plunder of the Greeks only yielded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>
four hundred thousand silver marks; but although this sum
far exceeded the revenues of all the kingdoms of the West,
it did not by any means represent the value of the riches
accumulated in Byzantium. If the princes and barons, upon
making themselves masters of the city, had been satisfied with
imposing a tribute upon the inhabitants, they might have
received a much larger sum; but this pacific manner of
obtaining wealth agreed neither with their character nor the
humour they were in. History asserts that the Venetians,
in this circumstance, offered them some very prudent advice,
and made propositions that were rejected with scorn. The
Frank warriors could not condescend to submit the advantages
of victory to commercial calculations; the produce of
pillage was always, in their eyes, the most worthy fruit of
conquest, and the most noble reward of valour.</p>

<p>When they had thus shared the rich plunder of the
Eastern empire, the Crusaders gave way to the most extravagant
joy, without perceiving that they had committed a
great fault in exhausting a country which was about to
become their own; they did not reflect that the ruin of the
conquered might one day bring on that of the conquerors,
and that they might become as poor as the Greeks they had
just despoiled. Without regrets, as without foresight, hoping
everything from their own good swords, they set about electing
a leader who should reign over a people in mourning and
a desolated city. The imperial purple had still the same
splendour in their eyes, and the throne, though shaken by
their arms, was still the object of their ambition. Six
electors were chosen from among the Venetian nobles, and
six others from among the French ecclesiastics, to give a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
master to Constantinople; the twelve electors assembled in
the palace of Bucoleon, and swore, upon the Gospel, to
crown only merit and virtue.</p>

<p>Three of the principal leaders of the crusade had equal
claims to the suffrages of the electors. If the purple was to
be the reward of experience, of ability in council, and of
services rendered to the cause of the Latins, Henry Dandolo,
who had been the moving spirit, the very soul of the enterprise,
certainly had the first claim to it. The marquis of
Montferrat, likewise, had titles worthy of great consideration;
the Latins had chosen him for their leader, and the
Greeks already acknowledged him as their master. His
bravery, proved in a thousand fights, promised a firm and
generous support to a throne that must rise from amidst
ruins. His prudence and moderation might give the Latins
and the people of Greece reason to hope that, when once
raised to empire, he would repair the evils of war. The
claims of Baldwin to the imperial crown were not less
cogent than those of his concurrents. The count of Flanders
was related to the most powerful monarchs of the West,
and was descended, in the female line, from Charlemagne.
He was much beloved by his soldiers, whose dangers he was
always ready to share; he had deservedly obtained the
esteem of the Greeks, who, even amidst the disorders of
conquest, celebrated him as the champion of chastity and
honour. Baldwin was the protector of the weak, the friend
of the poor; he loved justice, and had no dread of truth.
His youth, which he had already illustrated by brilliant exploits
and solid virtues, gave the subjects of the new empire
hopes of a long and happy reign; the rank he held among
the warriors, his piety, his intelligence, his love of study and
learned men, rendered him worthy of ascending the throne
of Augustus and Constantine.</p>

<p>The electors at first turned their attention towards the
venerable Dandolo; but the republicans of Venice trembled
at the idea of seeing an emperor among their fellow-citizens:
“What shall we not have to dread,” said they, “from a
Venetian, become master of Greece, and of part of the
East? Shall we be subject to his laws, or will he remain
subject to the laws of our country? Under his reign, and
under that of his successors, who will assure us that Venice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
the Queen of the Seas, will not become one of the cities of this
empire?” The Venetians, whilst speaking thus, bestowed
just eulogiums upon the virtue and character of Dandolo:
they added, that their doge, who was approaching the end
of a life filled with great actions, had nothing left him but
to finish his days with glory, and that he himself would find
it more glorious to be the head of a victorious republic, than
the sovereign of a conquered nation. “What Roman,”
cried they, “would have been willing to lay down the title
of citizen of Rome, to become king of Carthage?”</p>

<p>On terminating their speeches, the Venetians conjured
the assembly to elect an emperor from among the other
leaders of the army. After this, the choice of the electors
could only be directed towards the count of Flanders and
the marquis of Montferrat; the most wise dreading that
the one of the two concurrents who should not obtain the
empire, would be sure to give vent to his dissatisfaction,
and would desire the fall of the throne occupied by his
rival. They still remembered the violent debates which, in
the first crusade, had followed the election of Godfrey of
Bouillon; and the troubles excited in the young kingdom of
Jerusalem, by the jealous ambition of Raymond de St.
Gilles. To prevent the effects of such a fatal discord, it was
judged best to decree, at once, that the prince that should
gain the suffrages for the imperial throne, should yield to
the other, under the condition of fealty and homage, the
property of the island of Candia, and all the lands of the
empire situated on the other side of the Bosphorus. After
this decision, the assembly turned their whole attention to
the election of an emperor. Their choice was for a long
time uncertain. The marquis of Montferrat at first appeared
to have the majority of the suffrages; but the Venetians
were fearful of seeing upon the throne of Constantinople a
prince who had any possessions in the neighbourhood of
their territories, and represented to the assembly that the
election of Baldwin would be much more advantageous to
the Crusaders, particularly as it would interest the warlike
nations of the Flemings and French in the glory and support
of the new empire. The interests and jealousies of policy,
and, without doubt, also wisdom and equity, at length
united all voices in favour of the count of Flanders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>The Crusaders, assembled before the palace of Bucoleon,
awaited with impatience the decision of the electors. At
the hour of midnight, the bishop of Soissons came forward
under the vestibule, and pronounced, in a loud voice, these
words: “This hour of the night, which witnessed the birth
of a Saviour of the world, gives birth to a new empire,
under the protection of the Omnipotent. You have for
emperor, Baldwin, count of Flanders and Hainault.” Loud
cries of joy arose from among the Venetians and the
French. The people of Constantinople, who had so often
changed masters, received, without repugnance, the new one
just given to them, and mingled their acclamations with
those of the Latins. Baldwin was elevated upon a buckler,
and borne in triumph to the church of St. Sophia. The
marquis of Montferrat followed in the train of his rival; the
generous submission, of which he presented an example, was
much admired by his companions in arms, and his presence
drew scarcely less attention than the warlike pomp that
surrounded the new emperor.</p>

<p>The ceremony of the coronation was postponed till the
fourth Sunday after Easter. In the mean time the marriage
of the marquis of Montferrat with Margaret of Hungary,
the widow of Isaac, was celebrated with much splendour.
Constantinople beheld within its walls the festivities and
spectacles of the West, and, for the first time, the Greeks
heard in their churches the prayers and hymns of the
Latins. On the day appointed for the coronation of the
emperor, Baldwin repaired to St. Sophia, accompanied by
the barons and the clergy. Whilst divine service was being
performed, the emperor ascended a throne of gold, and
received the purple from the hands of the pope’s legate,
who performed the functions of patriarch. Two knights
carried before him the <i>laticlavici tunica</i> of the Roman consuls,
and the imperial sword, once again in the hands of
warriors and heroes. The head of the clergy, standing
before the altar, pronounced, in the Greek language, these
words: “<i>He is worthy of reigning</i>;” and all persons present
repeated in chorus, “<i>he is worthy! he is worthy!</i>” The
Crusaders shouting their boisterous acclamations, the knights
clad in armour, the crowd of miserable Greeks, the sanctuary
despoiled of its ancient ornaments, and decked with foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
pomp, presented altogether a spectacle solemn and melancholy&mdash;all
the evils of war amidst the trophies of victory.
Surrounded by the ruins of an empire, reflective spectators
could not fail to remark among the ceremonies of this day,
that in which, according to the custom of the Greeks, were
presented to Baldwin a little vase filled with dust and
bones, and a lock of lighted flax,<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> as symbols of the shortness
of life and the nothingness of human grandeur.</p>

<p>Before the ceremony of his coronation, the new emperor
distributed the principal dignities of the empire among his
companions in arms. Villehardouin, marshal of Champagne,
obtained the title of marshal of Romania; the count de
St. Pol, the dignity of constable; the charges of master of
the wardrobe, great cupbearer and butler, were given to
Canon de Bethune, Macaire de St. Ménéhoult, and Miles de
Brabant. The doge of Venice, created despot or prince of
Romania, had the right of wearing purple buskins, a privilege,
among the Greeks, reserved for members of the imperial
family. Henry Dandolo represented the republic of
Venice at Constantinople; half the city was under his
dominion and recognised his laws; he raised himself, by the
dignity of his character as well as by his exploits, above all
the princes and all the nobles of the court of Baldwin; he
alone was exempt from paying fealty and homage to the
emperor for the lands he was to possess.</p>

<p>The barons began to be impatient to share the cities and
provinces of the empire. In a council composed of twelve
of the patricians of Venice and twelve French knights, all
the conquered lands were divided between the two nations.
Bithynia, Romania or Thrace, Thessalonica, all Greece from
Thermopylæ to Cape Sunium, with the larger isles of the
Archipelago, fell to the share and under the dominion of the
French. The Venetians obtained the Cyclades and the Sporades,
in the Archipelago; the isles and the oriental coast of
the Adriatic Gulf; the coasts of the Propontis and the Euxine
Sea; the banks of the Hebrus and the Vardas; the cities of Cypsedes,
Didymatica, and Adrianople; the maritime countries of
Thessalonica, &amp;c. &amp;c. Such was at first the distribution of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
territories of the empire. But circumstances that could not
be foreseen, the diversity of interests, the rivalries of ambition,
all the chances of fortune and of war, soon produced
great changes in this division of dominions. History would
in vain endeavour to follow the conquerors into the provinces
allotted to them; it would be more easy to mark the banks
of an overflowing torrent, or to trace the path of the storm,
than to fix the state of the uncertain and transitory possessions
of the conquerors of Byzantium.</p>

<p>The lands situated beyond the Bosphorus were erected
into a kingdom, and, with the island of Candia, given to the
marquis of Montferrat. Boniface exchanged them for the
province of Thessalonica, and sold the island of Candia to
the republic of Venice for thirty pounds weight of gold.
The provinces of Asia were abandoned to the count of Blois,
who assumed the title of duke of Nice and Bithynia. In
the distribution of the cities and lands of the empire, every
one of the lords and barons had obtained domains proportionate
with the rank and services of the new possessor.
When they heard speak of so many countries of which they
scarcely knew the names, the warriors of the West were
astonished at their conquests, and believed that the greater
part of the universe was promised to their ambition. In the
intoxication of their joy, they declared themselves masters
of all the provinces that had formed the empire of Constantine.
They cast lots for the countries of the Medes and
Parthians, and the kingdoms that were under the domination
of the Turks and Saracens;<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> several barons expressed
a great desire to reign at Alexandria; others disputed for
the palace of the sultans of Iconium; some knights exchanged
that which had been assigned to them for new
possessions, whilst others complained of their share, and
demanded an augmentation of territory. With the money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
which arose from the plunder of the capital, the conquerors
purchased the provinces of the empire; they sold, they
played at dice, for whole cities and their inhabitants. Constantinople
was during several days a market, in which seas
and their islands, nations and their wealth, were trafficked
for; in which the Roman world was put up to sale, and
found purchasers among the obscure crowd of the Crusaders.</p>

<p>Whilst the barons were thus distributing cities and
kingdoms, the ambition of the Latin clergy was by no
means idle, but was busy in invading the property of the
Greek Church. All the churches of Constantinople were
divided between the French and the Venetians; they named
priests of the two nations, to minister in the temples torn
from the conquered; and no other religious ceremonies were
celebrated within the walls of the city but those of the West.
The leaders of the crusade had agreed among themselves,
that if the emperor of Constantinople should be chosen
from the French, the patriarch should be a Venetian. According
to this convention, which had preceded the conquest,
Thomas Morosini<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> was elevated to the chair of St. Sophia;
priests and Latin bishops were, at the same time, sent into
the other conquered cities, and took possession of the wealth
and the privileges of the Greek clergy. Thus the Romish
worship associated itself with the victories of the Crusaders,
and made its empire acknowledged wherever the banners of
the conquerors floated.</p>

<p>Nothing now opposed the arms of the Crusaders; all
trembled before them; fame wafted everywhere the accounts
of their exploits and their power; but, on casting a glance
into the future the leaders had great reason to fear that the
retreat or death of their warriors would leave the empire
they had founded destitute of defenders. The population,
weakened and dispersed, were not sufficient for either the
cultivation of the lands or the work of the cities. In this
conjuncture, the counts and barons, who always expected
with fear the judgments of the head of the Church, redoubled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
their submission to the sovereign pontiff, and sought
his support, in the hope that the Holy See would bring the
West to pronounce in their favour, and that at the voice of
the father of the faithful, a great number of French, Italians,
and Germans would come to people and defend the new
empire.</p>

<p>After his coronation, Baldwin wrote to the pope, to announce
to him the extraordinary victories by which it had
pleased God to crown the zeal of the soldiers of the cross.
The new emperor, who assumed the title of knight of the
Holy See, recalled to the mind of the sovereign pontiff the
perfidies and the long revolt of the Greeks. “We have
brought under your laws,” said he, “that city, which, in
hatred for the Holy See, would scarcely hear the name of
the prince of the apostles, and did not afford a single
church to him who received from the Lord the supremacy
over all churches.” Baldwin, in his letter, invited the vicar
of Jesus Christ to imitate the example of his predecessors,
John, Agapetus, and Leo, who visited in person the Church
of Byzantium. To complete the justification of the pilgrims
who had made themselves masters of the Greek empire,
the emperor invoked the testimony of all the Christians
of the East. “When we entered into this capital,” added
he, “many inhabitants of the Holy Land, who were there,
expressed greater joy than any others, and asserted aloud
that we had rendered God a more agreeable service than if
we had retaken Jerusalem.”</p>

<p>The marquis of Montferrat at the same time addressed
a letter to the sovereign pontiff, in which he protested his
humble obedience to all the decisions of the Holy See. “As
for me,” said the king of Thessalonica, “who only took up
the cross for the expiation of my sins, and not to obtain an
opportunity of sinning with more license under the pretext
of religion, I submit myself blindly to your will. If you
judge that my presence in Romania may be useful, I will die
there, contending against your enemies and those of Christ:
if you think, on the contrary, I ought to abandon these rich
countries, pay no regard to the wealth or dignities I possess
there, I am ready to return to the West; for I am not willing
to do anything that will draw upon me the anger of the
sovereign judge.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>The doge of Venice, who till that time had braved with
so much haughtiness the threats and thunders of the Church,
acknowledged the sovereign authority of the pope, and
joined his protestations with those of Baldwin and Boniface.
To disarm the anger of Innocent, they represented to him
that the conquest of Constantinople had prepared the deliverance
of Jerusalem, and boasted of the wealth of a country
which the Crusaders had at length brought under the
laws of the Holy See. In all their letters to the pope or
the faithful of the West, the conquerors of Byzantium
spoke of the Greek empire as of a new land of promise,
which awaited the servants of God and the soldiers of Christ.</p>

<p>Innocent had been for a long time irritated by the disobedience
of the Crusaders; in his reply, he reproached
with bitterness the victorious army of the Latins for having
preferred the riches of the earth to those of heaven;<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> he
reprimanded the leaders for having exposed to the outrages
of the soldiers and followers of the army, the honour of matrons
and maidens, and virgins consecrated to the Lord; for
having ruined Constantinople, plundered <i>both great and
small</i>, violated the sanctuary, and put forth a sacrilegious
hand upon the treasures of the churches. Nevertheless,
the father of the faithful would not take upon him to fathom
the judgments of God; he was satisfied to believe that the
Greeks had been justly punished for their faults, and that
the Crusaders were recompensed as the instruments of Providence,
as the avengers of divine justice. “Dread,” said
he, “the anger of the Lord; hope with fear that he will
pardon the past, if you govern the nations with equity; if
you are faithful to the Holy See, and, above everything, if
you entertain a firm resolution to accomplish your vow for
the deliverance of the Holy Land.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>Notwithstanding this outward show of anger, the sovereign
pontiff was gratified to the depths of his heart by the
prayers and submission of the heroes and princes whose exploits
made the Eastern world tremble. Cardinal Peter of
Capua had given absolution to the Venetians excommunicated
after the siege of Zara. Innocent at first blamed the
indulgence of his legate, but finished by confirming the pardon
granted to Dandolo and his compatriots. The pope
approved the election of Baldwin, who took the title of knight
of the Holy See, and consented to recognise an empire to which
he was to give laws. The more submissive the Crusaders
showed themselves to his authority, the more plainly it appeared
to him that their conquests must concern the glory
of God and that of the vicar of Christ upon earth. He
wrote to the bishops of France, that God had been willing
to console the Church by the conversion of heretics; that
Providence had humbled the Greeks, an impious, proud, and
rebellious people; and again placed the empire in the hands
of the Latins, a pious, humble, and submissive nation. The
sovereign pontiff invited, in the name of the emperor Baldwin,
the French of both sexes and all conditions, to repair
to Greece to receive lands and riches proportioned to their
merit and their quality. He promised the indulgences of
the crusade to all the faithful, who, sharing the glory of the
Crusaders, should go to defend and promote the prosperity
of the new empire of the East.</p>

<p>The pope did not, however, lose sight of the Syrian expedition,
and appeared persuaded that succours sent to Constantinople
must contribute to the deliverance of the holy
places. The king of Jerusalem implored more earnestly
than ever, both by letters and ambassadors, the effective
protection of the Holy See, as well as that of the princes of
the East.</p>

<p>The new emperor of Byzantium did not renounce the
hope of assisting the Christian colonies of Syria; and to
raise the courage of his brethren of the Holy Land, he sent
to Ptolemaïs the chain of the port and the gates of Constantinople.
When these trophies reached Palestine, scarcity,
famine, and all the evils of an unfortunate war ravaged both
cities and plains. At the news of approaching aid, the people
of Ptolemaïs passed at once from excessive grief and despondency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
to all the transports of joy. Fame, whilst publishing
the miraculous conquests of the companions of
Baldwin and Boniface, carried the hope of safety into all the
Christian cities of Syria, and spread terror among the Mussulmans.
The sultan of Damascus had recently concluded
a truce with the Christians, and trembled lest it should be
broken, when, all at once, he owed his safety to the very
event that had caused his alarms.</p>

<p>The greater part of the defenders of the Holy Land, who
had experienced nothing but the evils of war, became desirous
of partaking of the glory and the good fortune of the
French and Venetians. They even who had quitted the
victorious army at Zara, who had so severely blamed the
expedition to Constantinople, believed that the will of God
called them to the shores of the Bosphorus, and they abandoned
the Holy Land. The legate of the pope, Peter of
Capua, was drawn away by the example of the other Crusaders,
and went to animate with his presence the zeal of
the Latin clergy, who were labouring for the conversion of
the Greeks; the knights of St. John and the Temple also
directed their course towards Greece, where glory and rich
domains were the reward of valour; and the king of Jerusalem
was left almost alone at Ptolemaïs, without means of
making the truce he had entered into with the infidels
respected.</p>

<p>Baldwin warmly welcomed the defenders of the Holy
Land; but the joy he experienced at their arrival was much
troubled by the intelligence of the death of his wife, Marguerite
of Flanders. This princess had embarked in the
fleet of John de Nesle, in the belief that she should meet
her husband in Palestine; sinking under the fatigue of a
long voyage, and perhaps the pains of disappointment, she
fell sick at Ptolemaïs, and died at the moment she learnt
that Baldwin had been crowned emperor of Constantinople.
The vessel destined to convey the new empress to the shores
of the Bosphorus only brought back her mortal remains.
Baldwin, amidst his knights, wept for the loss of a princess
he had loved tenderly, and who, by her virtues and the
graces of her youth, he had hoped would be the ornament
and example of the court of Byzantium. He caused her to be
buried with great pomp in the same church in which, but a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
days before, he had received the imperial crown. Thus the
people of Constantinople witnessed, almost at the same time,
the coronation of an emperor and the funeral of an empress;&mdash;days
of joy and triumph mingled with days of mourning.
This contrast of the pageantry of death and the pomps of
victory and of a throne, appeared to offer a faithful image
of the glory of conquerors, and the future destiny of the
empire.</p>

<p>The emperor and his barons, with all the succours they
had received from the East, had scarcely twenty thousand
men to defend their conquests and restrain the people of the
capital and the provinces. The sultan of Iconium and the
king of the Bulgarians had long threatened to invade the
lands contiguous to their states, and they thought that the
dissensions and subsequent fall of the Greek empire presented
a favourable opportunity for the outbreak of their
jealousy and ambition. The nations of Greece were conquered
without being subdued. As in the disorder which
accompanied the conquest of Byzantium, no other right had
been acknowledged but that of force and the sword, all the
Greeks, who had still arms in their hands, were desirous of
forming a principality or a kingdom. On all sides new
states and empires sprang up from the bosom of the ruins,
and already threatened that which the Crusaders had so
recently established.</p>

<p>A grandson of Andronicus founded in a Greek province
of Asia Minor the principality of Trebizonde; Leo Sgurre,
master of the little city of Napoli, had extended his dominions
by injustice and violence, and, to employ a comparison
offered by Nicetas, he had grown greater, like the
torrent that swells in the storm and is enlarged by the
waters of the tempest. A barbarous conqueror, a fierce and
cruel tyrant, he reigned, or rather he spread terror, over
Argos and the isthmus of Corinth. Michael-Angelus Comnenus,
employing the arms of treachery, gained the kingdom
of Epirus, and subdued to his laws a wild and warlike people.
Theodore Lascaris, who, like Æneas, had fled from his
burning country, collected some troops in Bithynia, and
caused himself to be proclaimed emperor at Nice, whence
his family was destined at a future day to return in triumph
to Constantinople.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>If despair had imparted any degree of courage to the two
fugitive emperors, they might have obtained a share of their
own spoils, and preserved a remnant of power; but they had
not profited by the lessons of misfortune. Mourzoufle, who
had completed all the crimes begun by Alexius, did not
hesitate to place himself in the power of his unfortunate
rival, whose daughter he had married: the wicked sometimes
take upon themselves the duty of punishing one another.
Alexius, after having loaded Mourzoufle with caresses, inveigled
him into his house, and caused his eyes to be put
out. In this condition, Mourzoufle, abandoned by his followers,
for whom he was now nothing but an object of disgust,
went to conceal his existence and his misery in Asia; but on
his road fell into the hands of the Latins. Being led to
Constantinople, and condemned to expiate his crimes by an
ignominious death, he was precipitated from the top of a
column raised by the emperor Theodosius in the Place of
Taurus. The multitude of Greeks that had offered the
purple to Mourzoufle were present at his tragical end, and
appeared terrified at a punishment that was much more new
to them than the crimes for which it was inflicted. After
the execution, the crowd contemplated with surprise a basso-relievo
on the column of Theodosius,<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> which represented a
king falling from a very elevated place, and a city stormed
by sea. In these times of troubles and calamities, presages
were discovered everywhere. Everything, even to marble
and stone, appeared to have told of the misfortunes of Constantinople.
Nicetas was astonished that such great misfortunes
had not been announced by a shower of blood, or
some sinister prodigies; the most enlightened Greeks explained
the fall of the empire of Constantine by the verses
of poets and sibyls, or by the prophecies of the Scriptures;
the common people read the death of tyrants and their own
miseries in the looks of statues, and upon the columns that
remained standing in the capital.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>The perfidy and cruelty of Alexius did not remain long
unpunished; the usurper was obliged to wander from city to
city, and, not unfrequently, to conceal the imperial purple
under the garb of a mendicant. For a considerable time he
only owed his safety to the contempt in which he was held
by the conquerors. After having long strayed about in a
state of destitution, he was given up to the marquis of
Montferrat, who sent him a prisoner into Italy; escaping
thence, he again passed into Asia, and found an asylum with
the sultan of Iconium. Alexius could not be satisfied to
live in peace in his retreat, but joined the Turks in an attack
upon his son-in-law Lascaris, whom he could not pardon for
having saved a wreck of the empire, and reigning over
Bithynia. As the Turks were beaten, the fugitive prince
fell at length into the hands of the emperor of Nice, who
compelled him to retire to a monastery, where he died,
forgotten by both Greeks and Latins.</p>

<p>Thus four emperors were immolated to ambition and
vengeance:&mdash;a deplorable spectacle, and most worthy of
pity! Amidst the convulsions and fall of an empire, we
behold princes of the same family quarrelling for a phantom
of authority, snatch from each other by turns both the
sceptre and life, surpass the populace in fury, and leave
them no crime, no parricide, to commit.</p>

<p>If we could believe Nicetas, Alexius was a model of
mildness and moderation: he never made a woman put on
mourning for her husband, he never caused a citizen to weep
for the loss of his fortune. This eulogy of Nicetas throws
a far greater light upon the nature of the government than
upon the qualities of the monarch. If it be true that we
ought to be thankful to despotism for every ill that it has
not committed, we must not forget that Alexius only obtained
the throne by infamous means; that he did not redeem
his parricide by any public virtue; and that the crime of his
usurpation gave birth to a thousand other crimes, brought
about a horrible revolution, and caused the ruin of a nation.
Nicetas treats Mourzoufle with much more severity; but
some modern historians, dazzled by a few actions of bravery,
have undertaken to justify a prince who sacrificed everything
to his ambition. They have not hesitated to point out to
us in a cruel, unscrupulous tyrant, a model and a martyr of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
the patriotic virtues, as if love of country was the same
thing as a boundless love of power, and could possibly ally
itself with treachery and parricide.</p>

<p>Whilst the Greek princes were thus making war against
each other, and quarrelling for the wrecks of the empire,
the French counts and barons quitted the capital to go and
take possession of the cities and provinces that had fallen to
their share. Many of them were obliged to conquer, sword
in hand, the lands that had been assigned to them. The
marquis of Montferrat set out on his march to visit the
kingdom of Thessalonica, and receive the homage of his new
subjects. The emperor Baldwin, followed by his brother
Henry of Hainault, and a great number of knights, made a
progress through Thrace and Romania, and everywhere on
his passage, was saluted by the noisy acclamations of a people
always more skilful in nattering their conquerors than in
combating their enemies. When he arrived at Adrianople,
where he was received in triumph, the new emperor announced
his intention of pursuing his march as far as
Thessalonica. This unexpected resolution surprised the
marquis of Montferrat, who entertained the desire of going
alone to his own kingdom. Boniface promised to be faithful
to the emperor, to be always ready to employ his forces
against the enemies of the empire; but he feared the presence
of Baldwin’s army in his cities, already exhausted by
war. A serious quarrel broke out between the two princes.
The marquis of Montferrat accused the emperor of wishing
to get possession of his states; Baldwin fancied he could
perceive in the resistance of Boniface the secret design of
denying the sovereignty of the head of the empire. Both
loved justice, and were not wanting in moderation; but now
one had become king of Thessalonica, and the other emperor
of Constantinople, they had courtiers, who endeavoured to
exasperate their quarrel and inflame their animosity. Some
told Boniface that Baldwin was entirely in the wrong, and that
he abused a power that ought to have been the reward of
virtues very different from his. Others reproached the
emperor with being too generous to his enemies, and, in the
excess of their flattery, said he was guilty of only one fault,
and that was of having too long spared an unfaithful vassal.
In spite of all the representations of the marquis of Montferrat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Baldwin led his army into the kingdom of Thessalonica.
Boniface considered this obstinacy of the emperor
as a flagrant outrage, and swore to take vengeance with his
sword. Impelled by passion, he departed suddenly with
several knights who had declared in his favour, and got
possession of Didymatica, a city belonging to the emperor.</p>

<p>The marquis of Montferrat took with him his wife, Mary of
Hungary, the widow of Isaac; and the presence of this princess,
with the hopes of keeping up the division among the
Latins, drew many Greeks to the banner of Boniface. He
declared to them that he fought for their cause, and clothed in
the imperial purple a young prince, the son of Isaac and Mary
of Hungary. Dragging in his train this phantom of an
emperor, around whom the principal inhabitants from all
parts of Romania rallied, he resumed the road to Adrianople,
and made preparations for besieging that city. Boniface,
daily becoming more irritated, would listen to neither the
counsels nor the prayers of his companions in arms; and
discord was about to cause the blood of the Latins to flow, if
the doge of Venice, the count of Blois, and the barons that
remained at Constantinople, had not earnestly employed
their authority and credit to prevent the misfortunes with
which the new empire was threatened. Deeply afflicted by
what they learnt, they sent deputies to the emperor and the
marquis of Montferrat. The marshal of Champagne, the
envoy to Boniface, reproached him, in plain terms, with
having forgotten the glory and honour of the Crusaders, of
whom he had been the leader; with compromising, to gratify
a vain pride, the cause of Christ and the safety of the empire,
and preparing days of triumph and joy for the Greeks, the
Bulgarians, and the Saracens. The marquis of Montferrat
was touched by the reproaches of Villehardouin, who was
his friend, and who spoke in the name of all the Crusaders.
He promised to put an end to the war, and to submit his
quarrel with Baldwin to the judgment of the counts and
barons.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Baldwin had taken possession of Thessalonica.
As soon as he heard of the hostilities of the marquis
of Montferrat, he hastily marched back to Adrianople. He
was brooding over projects of vengeance, and threatening to
repel force by force, and oppose war to war, when he met the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
deputies, who came in the name of the leaders of the
crusade, to speak to him of peace, and recall to his heart the
sentiments of justice and humanity. A knight of the train
of the count of Blois addressed a speech to the emperor,
that Villehardouin has preserved, in which our readers will
be pleased, without doubt, to meet with a picture of the
noble frankness of the conquerors of Byzantium. “Sire,”
said he, “the doge of Venice, the Count Louis of Blois, my
very honoured lord, and all the barons who are at Constantinople,
salute you as their sovereign, and make complaint
to God and you against those who, by their evil counsels,
have created fatal discords. You did, certes, very wrong to
lend an ear to these perfidious counsellors, for they are our
enemies and yours. You know that the Marquis Boniface
has submitted his quarrel to the judgment of the barons; the
lords and princes hope that you will do as he has done, and
that you will not hold out against justice. They have
sworn, and we are charged to declare so in their name, not
to suffer any longer the scandal of a war kindled between
Crusaders.”</p>

<p>Baldwin did not at first answer this speech, and appeared
surprised at such language; but they spoke to him thus in
the name of the doge of Venice, whose old age he respected,
and whom he loved tenderly; in the name of the counts and
barons, without whose help he could not hope to preserve
his empire, and, at length, he listened to the united voices
of reason and friendship. He promised to lay down his
arms, and repair to Constantinople, to adjust the quarrel
between him and the marquis of Montferrat. On his arrival,
the counts and barons spared neither complaints nor
prayers, and they found him docile to all their counsels.
The marquis of Montferrat, who very shortly followed him,
entered the capital with a degree of mistrust; he was
accompanied by a hundred knights, with their men-at-arms;
but the welcome he received from Baldwin and the other
leaders completely appeased all his resentments, and dissipated
all his misgivings. From that time the re-establishment
of harmony and peace became the sincere object of the
Crusaders. The doge of Venice, the counts and barons,
with the most respected of the knights, who reminded the
masters of the new empire of the redoubtable institution of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the <span class="smcap">PEERS</span> of the West, gave judgment in the quarrel that
was submitted to them, and pronounced, without appeal,
between the king of Thessalonica and the emperor of Constantinople.
The two princes swore never to listen again
to perfidious counsels, and embraced in presence of the
army, who rejoiced at the return of concord, as they would
have done at a great victory obtained over the enemies of
the empire. “Great evil might they have done,” says
Villehardouin, “who excited this discord; for if God had not
taken pity on the Crusaders, they were in danger of losing
their conquests, and Christianity might have perished.”</p>

<p>As soon as peace was re-established, the knights and
barons again quitted the capital to pass through the provinces,
and subdue such as were refractory. The count of
Blois, who had obtained Bithynia, sent his knights across
the Bosphorus; the troops of the Crusaders gained several
advantages over those of Lascaris. Penamenia, Lopada,
Nicomedia, and some other cities, opened their gates to the
conquerors, after a feeble resistance. The Latins brought
under their dominion all the coasts of the Propontis and the
Bosphorus, as far as the ancient Eolis. Henry of Hainault
was not idle in this new war; whilst the warriors of the
count of Blois were pushing their conquests towards Nice,
he led his men-at-arms into Phrygia, unfurled his triumphant
banners in the plains where Troy once stood, fought at the
same time both Greeks and Turks, in the fields which had
been trod by the armies of Xerxes and Alexander, and took
possession of all the country that extends from the Hellespont
to Mount Ida.</p>

<p>At the same time the marquis of Montferrat, now the
peaceable master of Thessalonica, undertook the conquest of
Greece.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> He advanced into Thessaly, passed the chain of
mountains of Olympus and Ossa, and took possession of
Larissa. Boniface and his knights, without fear and without
danger, passed through the narrow straits of Thermopylæ,
and penetrated into Bœotia and Attica. They put to flight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Leo Sgurre, who was the scourge of a vast province; and
their exploits might have reminded the Greeks of those
heroes of the early ages who travelled about the world
fighting monsters and subduing tyrants. As all the Greeks,
for so long a time oppressed, sighed for a change, the heroes
of the crusades were everywhere received as liberators.
Whilst Boniface was becoming possessed of the beautiful
countries of Greece, Geoffrey de Villehardouin, nephew of
the marshal of Champagne, established the authority of the
Latins in the Peloponnesus. After having driven the troops
of Michael Comnenus to the mountains of Epirus, he occupied,
without fighting, Coronea and Patras, and met with no
resistance except in the canton of Lacedæmonia. The
conquered lands and cities were given to the barons, who
rendered fealty and homage to the king of Thessalonica and
the emperor of Constantinople.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> Greece then beheld lords
of Argos and Corinth, grand sieurs of Thebes, dukes of
Athens, and princes of Achaia. French knights dictated
laws in the city of Agamemnon, in the city of Minerva,<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> in
the country of Lycurgus, and in that of Epaminondas.
Strange destiny of the warriors of this crusade, who had
quitted the West to conquer the city and lands of Jesus
Christ, and whom fortune had conducted into places filled
with the remembrances of the gods of Homer and the glory
of profane antiquity!</p>

<p>The Crusaders were not allowed to felicitate themselves
long upon their conquests. Possessors of an empire much
more difficult to be preserved than invaded, they had not the
ability to master fortune, who soon took from them all that
victory had bestowed. They exercised their power with
violence, and conciliated neither their subjects nor their
neighbours. Joannice, king of the Bulgarians, had sent an
ambassador to Baldwin, with offers of friendship; Baldwin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
replied with much haughtiness, and threatened to compel
Joannice to descend from his usurped throne. When
despoiling the Greeks of their property, the Crusaders shut
out from themselves every source of prosperity, and reduced
men to whom they left nothing but life, to despair. To fill
up the measure of their imprudence, they received into their
armies the Greeks, whom they loaded with contempt, and
who became their implacable enemies. Not content with
reigning over cities, they were desirous of subjugating
hearts to their will, and awakened fanaticism. Unjust persecutions
exasperated the minds of the Greek priests, who
declaimed with vehemence against tyranny, and who, reduced
to misery, were listened to as oracles and revered as
martyrs.</p>

<p>The new empire of the Latins, into which the feudal laws
had been introduced, was divided into a thousand principalities
or lordships, and was nothing but a species of republic,
governed with great difficulty. The Venetians had their
particular jurisdiction, and the greater part of the cities were
regulated by turns by the legislation of Venice and the code
of feudalism. The lords and barons had among themselves
opposite interests and rivalries, which, every day, were likely
to bring on discord and civil war. The Latin ecclesiastics,
who had shared the spoils of the Greek Church, did not at all
conciliate peace by their example, but carried the scandals
of their dissensions even into the sanctuary. It was their
constant wish and endeavour to exalt the laws and authority
of the court of Rome over those of the emperors. Many of
them had usurped the fiefs of the barons, and as the fiefs
they possessed were exempted from military service, the
empire thus became weakened in its natural defences.</p>

<p>The delicious climate and the riches of Greece, with the
long sojourn at Constantinople, enervated the courage of
the conquerors, and fostered corruption among the soldiers
of the cross. The nations in the end ceased to respect the
power and the laws of those whose morals and manners they
despised. As the Latins had separated, some to go into
Greece, and others into Asia Minor, the Greeks, who no
longer beheld great armies, and who had sometimes resisted
their enemies with advantage, began to fancy that the
warriors of the West were not invincible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>In their despair, the conquered people resolved to have
recourse to arms; and, looking around them to find enemies
for the Crusaders, they implored the alliance and protection
of the king of the Bulgarians. There was formed a widely-extended
conspiracy, into which all entered to whom slavery
was no longer tolerable. All at once the storm burst forth
by the massacre of the Latins; a war-cry arose from Mount
Hemus to the Hellespont; the Crusaders, dispersed in the
various cities and countries, were surprised by a furious and
pitiless enemy. The Venetians and French, who guarded
Adrianople and Didymatica, were not able to resist the
multitude of the Greeks; some were slaughtered in the
streets; others retired in disorder, and, in their flight,
beheld with grief their banners torn down from the towers,
and replaced by the standards of the Bulgarians. The roads
were covered with fugitive warriors, who found no asylum
in a country which lately trembled at the fame of their
arms.</p>

<p>Every city besieged by the Greeks was ignorant of the
fate of the other cities confided to the defence of the Latins;
communications were interrupted; sinister rumours prevailed
in the provinces, which represented the capital in flames, all
the cities given up to pillage, and all the armies of the
Franks dispersed or annihilated. The old chronicles, whilst
speaking of the barbarity of the Greeks, also describe the
terror that took possession of some of the barons and knights.
The sense of danger appears to have stifled in their hearts
every other feeling. In the hour of peril, crusaders abandoned
their companions in arms, brothers abandoned
brothers. An old knight, Robert de Trils, who, in spite of
his grey hairs, had insisted upon following his son to the
crusade, was besieged by the Greeks in Philippolis; the city
was surrounded by enemies, and Robert had but slender
hopes of safety. Even in such circumstances, his prayers
and tears could not prevail upon either his son or his son-in-law
to remain with him. Villehardouin informs us that
these recreant warriors were slain in their flight; for God
would not save those who had refused to succour their own
father.</p>

<p>When the report of these disasters reached Constantinople,
Baldwin assembled the counts and barons; it was determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
to apply the promptest remedy to so many evils, and
to put into action all the energies of the empire to stop the
progress of the revolt. The Crusaders who were engaged
in warlike expeditions on the other side of the Bosphorus,
received orders to abandon their conquests, and to return
immediately to the standards of the main army. Baldwin
waited for them several days, but as he was impatient to
begin the war, and wished to astonish the enemy by the
promptitude of his proceedings, he set out at the head of
the knights that remained in the capital, and, five days after
his departure, appeared before the walls of Adrianople.</p>

<p>The leaders of the crusade, accustomed to brave all
obstacles, were never checked or restrained by the small
number of their own soldiers, or the multitude of their
enemies. The capital of Thrace, surrounded by impregnable
ramparts, was defended by a hundred thousand
Greeks, in whom thirst of vengeance supplied the want of
courage. Baldwin mustered scarcely eight thousand men
around his banners. The doge of Venice soon arrived with
eight thousand Venetians. The Latin fugitives came from
all parts to join this small army. The Crusaders pitched
their tents, and prepared to lay siege to the city. Their
preparations proceeded but slowly, and provisions were
beginning to fail them, when the report reached them of the
march of the king of the Bulgarians. Joannice, the leader
of a barbarous people, himself more barbarous than his subjects,
was advancing with a formidable army. He concealed
his ambitious projects and his desire for vengeance under an
appearance of religious zeal, and caused a standard of St.
Peter, which he had received from the pope, to be borne
before him. This new ally of the Greeks boasted of being
a leader of a holy enterprise, and threatened to exterminate
the Franks, whom he accused of having assumed the cross
for the purpose of ravaging the provinces and pillaging the
cities of Christians.</p>

<p>The king of the Bulgarians was preceded in his march by
a numerous troop of Tartars and Comans, whom the hopes
of pillage had drawn from the mountains and forests near
the banks of the Danube and the Borysthenes. The Comans,
more ferocious than the nations of Mount Hemus, drank, it
was said, the blood of their captives, and sacrificed Christians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
on the altars of their idols. Like the warriors of
Scythia, accustomed to fight whilst flying, the Tartar horsemen
received orders from Joannice to provoke the enemy,
even in their camp, and to endeavour to draw the heavy
cavalry of the Franks into an ambuscade. The barons were
aware of this danger, and forbade the Crusaders to quit
their tents, or go beyond their intrenchments. But such
was the character of the French warriors, that prudence, in
their eyes, deprived valour of all its lustre, and it appeared
disgraceful to shun the fight in the presence and amidst the
scoffs of an enemy.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the Tartars appeared near the camp, when
the sight of them made even the leaders themselves forget
the orders they had issued only the night before. The emperor
and the count of Blois flew to meet the enemy, put
them to flight, and pursued them with ardour for the space
of two leagues. But all at once the Tartars rallied, and in
their turn charged the Christians. The latter, who believed
they had gained a victory, were obliged to defend themselves
in a country with which they were unacquainted.
Their squadrons, exhausted by fatigue, were surprised and
surrounded by the army of Joannice; pressed on all sides,
they made useless efforts to recover their line of battle, but
had no power either to fly, or resist the barbarians.</p>

<p>The count of Blois endeavoured to retrieve his fatal imprudence
by prodigies of valour; when seriously wounded
he was thrown from his horse amidst the enemy’s ranks, one
of his knights raised him up, and wished to draw him out of
the <i>mêlée</i>: “No,” cried this brave prince, “leave me to fight
and die. God forbid I should ever be reproached with
having fled from battle.” As he finished these words, the
count of Blois fell, covered with wounds, and his faithful
squire died by his side.</p>

<p>The emperor Baldwin still disputed the victory; the
bravest of his knights and barons followed him into the
<i>mêlée</i>, and a horrible carnage marked their progress through
the ranks of the barbarians. Peter bishop of Bethlehem,
Stephen count of Perche, Renaud de Montmirail, Mathieu
de Valencourt, Robert de Ronçai, and a crowd of lords and
valiant warriors lost their lives in defending their sovereign.
Baldwin remained almost alone on the field of battle, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
still continued fighting bravely; but at length, overpowered
by numbers, he fell into the hands of the Bulgarians, who
loaded him with chains. The wreck of the army retired in
the greatest disorder, and only owed their safety to the
prudent bravery of the doge of Venice and the marshal of
Champagne, who had been left to guard the camp.</p>

<p>In the night that followed the battle, the Crusaders raised
the siege of Adrianople, and retook the route to the capital,
amidst a thousand dangers. The Bulgarians and the Comans,
proud of their victory, pursued without intermission the
army they had conquered; this army, which had lost half of
its numbers, was in great want of provisions, and had great
difficulty in dragging along the wounded and the baggage.
The Crusaders were plunged in a melancholy silence, their
despair was evident in their actions and on their countenances.
At Rodosto they met Henry of Hainault, and
several other knights, who were on their way from the provinces
of Asia, to join the army of Adrianople. The retreating
leaders related with tears their defeat and the captivity
of Baldwin. All these warriors, who knew not what it was
to be conquered, expressed at once their astonishment and
their grief; they mingled their lamentations and tears, and
raised their hands and eyes towards heaven, to implore the
divine mercy. The Crusaders who returned from the shores
of the Bosphorus, addressed the marshal of Romania, and
weeping, said to him: “Order us where the greatest danger
exists, for we no longer wish to live: are we not sufficiently
unfortunate in not having come in time to succour our emperor?”
Thus the knights of the cross, though pursued by
a victorious enemy, were still strangers to fear; the grief
caused by the remembrance of their defeat scarcely allowed
them to be sensible of the perils by which they were
threatened.</p>

<p>All the Crusaders, however, did not exhibit this noble
degree of courage; many knights<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> whom Villehardouin is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
not willing to name, that he may not dishonour their
memory, abandoned the banners of the army and fled to
Constantinople; they related the disasters of the Crusaders,
and, to excuse their desertion, drew a lamentable picture of
the misfortunes that threatened the empire. All the Franks
were seized with grief and terror, on learning they had no
longer an emperor. The Greeks that inhabited the capital,
applauded in secret the triumph of the Bulgarians, and their
ill-concealed joy still further increased the alarms of the
Latins. A great number of knights, overcome by so many
reverses, saw no safety but in flight, and embarked hastily
on board some Venetian vessels. In vain the legate of the
pope and several leaders of the army endeavoured to detain
them, threatening them with the anger of God and the contempt
of men: they renounced their own glory; they abandoned
an empire founded by their arms, and went to announce
the captivity of Baldwin in the cities of the West, where the
rejoicings for the first victories of the Crusaders were still
being celebrated.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Joannice continued his pursuit of the
conquered army. The Greeks, united with the Bulgarians,
took possession of all the provinces, and left the Latins no
repose. Among the disasters of which contemporary history
has left us a deplorable account, we must not forget the
massacre of twenty thousand Armenians. This numerous
colony had left the banks of the Euphrates, and established
themselves in the province of Natolia. After the conquest
of Constantinople, they declared for the Latins, and when
the latter experienced their reverses, finding themselves
menaced and pursued by the Greeks, they crossed the Bosphorus,
and followed Henry of Hainault, who was marching
towards Adrianople. The Armenians took with them their
flocks and their families: they drew, in carriages, all that they
possessed that was most valuable, and had great difficulty,
on their march across the mountains of Thrace, in keeping
up with the army of the Crusaders. These unfortunate
people were surprised by the Tartars, and, to a man, perished
beneath the swords of a pitiless conqueror. The Franks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
wept at the defeat and destruction of the Armenians,
without being able to avenge them: they had nothing but
enemies throughout the vast provinces of the empire.
Beyond the Bosphorus, they only preserved the castle of
Peges: on the European side, only Rodosto and Selembria.
Their conquests in ancient Greece were not yet threatened
by the Bulgarians; but these distant possessions only served
to divide their forces. Henry of Hainault, who took the
title of regent, performed prodigies of valour in endeavouring
to retake some of the cities of Thrace; and lost, in
various combats, a great number of the warriors that remained
under his banners.</p>

<p>The bishop of Soissons and some other Crusaders, invested
with the confidence of their unfortunate companions
in arms, were sent into Italy, France, and the county of
Flanders, to solicit the assistance of the knights and barons
but the succour they hoped for could only arrive slowly, and
the enemy continued to make rapid progress. The army of
the Bulgarians, like a violent tempest, advanced on all sides;
it desolated the shores of the Hellespont, extended its
ravages into the kingdom of Thessalonica, repassed Mount
Hemus, and returned, more numerous and more formidable
than ever, to the banks of the Hebrus. The Latin empire
had no other defenders but a few warriors divided among
the various cities and fortresses, and every day war and desertion
diminished the numbers and strength of the unfortunate
conquerors of Byzantium. Five hundred knights,
picked warriors of the army of the Crusaders, were attacked
before the walls of Rusium, and cut to pieces by a countless
multitude of Bulgarians and Comans. This defeat was not
less fatal than the battle of Adrianople; the hordes of
Mount Hemus and the Borysthenes carried terror everywhere.
On their passage, the country was in flames, and
the cities afforded neither refuge nor means of defence.
The land was covered with soldiers, who slaughtered all who
came in their way; the sea was covered with pirates, who
threatened every coast with their brigandage. Constantinople
expected every day to see the standards of the victorious
Joannice beneath its walls, and only owed its safety
to the excess of evils that desolated all the provinces
of the empire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>The king of the Bulgarians did not spare his allies any
more than his enemies; he burnt and demolished all the
cities that fell into his hands. He ruined the inhabitants,
dragged them in his train like captives, and made them
undergo, in addition to the calamities of war, all the outrages
of a jealous and barbarous tyranny. The Greeks, who
had solicited his assistance, were at last reduced to implore
the aid of the Latins against the implacable fury of their
allies. The Crusaders accepted with joy the alliance with
the Greeks, whom they never ought to have repulsed, and
re-entered into Adrianople. Didymatica, and most of the
cities of Romania, shook off the intolerable yoke of the
Bulgarians, and submitted to the Latins. The Greeks,
whom Joannice had urged on to despair, showed some bravery,
and became useful auxiliaries to the Latins; and the new
empire might have hoped for a return of days of prosperity
and glory, if so many calamities could possibly have been
repaired by a few transient successes. But all the provinces
were strewed with ruins, and the cities and countries were
without inhabitants. The hordes of Mount Hemus, whether
victorious or conquered, still continued their predatory
habits. They easily recovered from their losses; the losses
of the Franks became every day more irreparable. The
leader of the Bulgarians sought out everywhere the foes of
the new empire; and, being abandoned by the Greeks of
Romania, he formed an alliance with Lascaris, the implacable
enemy of the Latins.</p>

<p>The pope in vain exhorted the nations of France and
Italy to take up arms for the assistance of the conquerors
of Byzantium; he could not awaken their enthusiasm for a
cause that presented to its defenders nothing but certain
evils, and dangers without glory.</p>

<p>Amidst the perils that continued to multiply, the Crusaders
remained perfectly ignorant of the fate of Baldwin; sometimes
it was said that he had broken his bonds, and had
been seen wandering in the forests of Servia;<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
that he had died of grief in prison; sometimes that he had
been massacred in the midst of a banquet by the king of
the Bulgarians; that his mutilated members had been cast
out upon the rocks, and that his skull, enchased in gold,
served as a cup for his barbarous conqueror. Several messengers,
sent by Henry of Hainault, travelled through the
cities of Bulgaria to learn the fate of Baldwin; but returned
to Constantinople, without having been able to ascertain
anything. A year after the battle of Adrianople, the pope,
at the solicitation of the Crusaders, conjured Joannice to
restore to the Latins of Byzantium the head of their new
empire. The king of the Bulgarians contented himself
with replying, that Baldwin had paid the tribute of nature,
and that his deliverance was no longer in the power of mortals.
This answer destroyed all hopes of again seeing the
imprisoned monarch, and the Latins no longer entertained a
doubt of the death of their emperor. Henry of Hainault
received the deplorable heritage of his brother with tears
and deep regret, and succeeded to the empire amidst general
mourning and sorrow. To complete their misfortunes, the
Latins had to weep for the loss of Dandolo, who finished his
glorious career at Constantinople, and whose last looks
must have perceived the rapid decline of an empire he had
founded.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> The greater part of the Crusaders had either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
perished in battle, or returned to the West. Boniface, in
an expedition against the Bulgarians of Rhodope, received a
mortal wound, and his head was carried in triumph to the
fierce Joannice, who had already immolated a monarch to
his ambition and vengeance. The succession of Boniface
gave birth to serious disputes among the Crusaders; and the
kingdom of Thessalonica, which had exhibited some splendour
during its short existence, disappeared amidst the
confusion and the storms of a civil and a foreign war. In
the brother and successor of Baldwin were united the civil
and military virtues; but he could scarcely hope to restore
a power so shaken on all sides.</p>

<p>I have not the courage to pursue this history, and describe
the Latins in the extremes of their abasement and misery.
On commencing my narration, I said: “<i>Evil to the conquered</i>;”
on terminating it, I cannot refrain from saying:
“<i>Evil to the conquerors</i>.”</p>

<p>An old empire which moulders away, a new empire ready
to sink into ruins, such are the pictures that this crusade
presents to us; never did any epoch offer greater exploits
for admiration, or greater troubles for commiseration.
Amidst these glorious and tragical scenes, the imagination
is excited in the most lively manner, and passes, without
ceasing, from surprise to surprise. We are at first astonished
at seeing an army of thirty thousand men embark to
conquer a country which might reckon upon many millions
of defenders; a tempest, an epidemic disease, want of provisions,
disunion among the leaders, an indecisive battle, all,
or any of these, might have ruined the army of the Crusaders,
and brought about the failure of their enterprise.
By an unheard-of good fortune, nothing that they had to
dread happened to them. They triumphed over all dangers,
and surmounted all obstacles: without having any party
among the Greeks, they obtained possession of their capital
and the provinces; and, at the moment when they saw their
standards triumphant all around them, it was that their
fortune deserted them and their ruin began. A great
lesson is this, given to nations by Providence, which sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
employs conquerors to chastise both people and
princes, and then, at its pleasure, destroys the instrument
of its justice! There is no doubt that that Providence,
which protects empires, will not permit great states to be
subverted with impunity; and to deter those who wish to
conquer everything by force of arms, it has decreed that
victory shall sometimes bear none but very bitter fruits.</p>

<p>The Greeks, a degenerate nation, honoured their misfortunes
by no virtue; they had neither sufficient courage
to prevent the reverses of war, nor sufficient resignation to
support them. When reduced to despair, they showed
some little valour; but that valour was imprudent and
blind; it precipitated them into new calamities, and procured
them masters much more barbarous than those whose
yoke they were so eager to shake off. They had no leader
able to govern or guide them; no sentiment of patriotism
strong enough to rally them: deplorable example of a nation
left to itself, which has lost its morals, and has no confidence
in its laws or its government!</p>

<p>The Franks had just the same advantages over their
enemies that the barbarians of the north had over the
Romans of the Lower Empire. In this terrible conflict,
simplicity of manners, the energy of a new people for civilization,
the ardour for pillage, and the pride of victory, were
sure to prevail over the love of luxury, habits formed amidst
corruption, and vanity which attaches importance to the
most frivolous things, and only preserves a gaudy resemblance
of true grandeur.</p>

<p>The events we have recorded are, doubtless, sufficient to
make us acquainted with the manners and intellectual
faculties of the Greeks and Latins. Two historians, however,
who have served us as guides, may add by their style
even, and the character of their works, to the idea that we
form of the genius of the two races.</p>

<p>The Greek Nicetas makes long lamentations over the
misfortunes of the vanquished; he deplores with bitterness
the loss of the monuments, the statues, the riches which
ministered to the luxury of his compatriots. His accounts,
full of exaggeration and hyperboles, sprinkled all over with
passages from the Scriptures and profane authors, depart
almost always from the noble simplicity of history, and only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
exhibit a vain affectation of learning. Nicetas, in the excess
of his vanity,<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> hesitates to pronounce the names even of the
Franks, and fancies he inflicts a punishment upon them by
preserving silence as to their exploits; when he describes
the misfortunes of the empire, he can only weep and
lament; but whilst lamenting, he is still anxious to please,
and appears much more interested about his book than his
country.</p>

<p>The marquis of Champagne does not pique himself upon
his erudition, but even seems proud of his ignorance. It
has been said that he could not write, and he himself confesses
that he dictated his history. His narration, void of
all spirit of research, but lively and animated, constantly
recalls the language and the noble frankness of a <i>preux
chevalier</i>. Villehardouin particularly excels in the speeches
of his heroes, and delights in praising the bravery of his
companions: if he never names the Grecian warriors, it is
because he did not know them, and did not wish to know
them. The marshal of Champagne is not affected by the
evils of war, and only elevates his style to paint traits of
heroism; the enthusiasm of victory alone can draw tears
from him. When the Latins experienced great reverses, he
cannot weep, he is silent; and it may be plainly seen he has
laid down his book to go and fight.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>There is another contemporary historian, whose character
may likewise assist us in forming a judgment upon the age
in which he lived and the events he has related. Gunther,
a monk of the order of Citeaux, who wrote under the dictation
of Martin Litz, expatiates upon the preachings of
the crusade, and on the virtues of his abbot, who placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
himself at the head of the Crusaders of the diocese of Bâle.
When the Christian army directs its course towards the
capital of the Greek empire, Gunther remembers the orders
of the pope, and becomes silent; if he affords us a few
words upon the second siege of Constantinople, he cannot
conceal the terror which this rash enterprise creates in him.
In his recital, the valour of the Crusaders scarcely obtains a
modest eulogy; the imagination of the historian is only
struck by the difficulties and perils of the expedition; filled
with the most sinister presentiments, he constantly repeats
that there is no hope of success for the Latins. When they
are triumphant, his fear is changed all at once into admiration.
The monk Gunther celebrates with enthusiasm the
unhoped-for success of the conquerors of Byzantium, among
whom he never loses sight of his abbot, Martin Litz, loaded
with the pious spoils of Greece.</p>

<p>When reading the three histories contemporary with the
expedition to Constantinople, we plainly perceive that the
first belongs to a Greek brought up at the court of Byzantium,
the second to a French knight, and the third to a
monk. If the two first historians, by their manner of writing
and the sentiments they express, give us a just idea of
the Greek nation and the heroes of the West, the last may
also explain to us the opinions and the character of the
greater part of those Crusaders, who were constantly threatening
to quit the army after it had left Venice, and who,
perhaps, were only so mindful of the oath they had made to
go to the Holy Land, because the name alone of Constantinople
filled them with terror. There were, as may be
plainly seen, but very few of these timid Crusaders in the
Christian army, and even these were governed by the general
spirit that animated the knights and barons. Other
crusades had been preached in councils, this crusade was
proclaimed at tournaments; thus the greater parts of the
Crusaders proved more faithful to the virtues and laws of
chivalry than to the will of the Holy See. These warriors,
so proud and so brave, were full of respect for the authority
and judgment of the pope; but, governed by honour, placed
between their first vows and their word given to the Venetians,
they often swore to deliver Jerusalem, and were led,
without thinking of it, to the walls of Constantinople.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Armed to avenge the cause of Christ, they became subservient
to the ambition of Venice, to which republic they
esteemed themselves bound by gratitude, and overturned
the throne of Constantinople to pay a debt of fifty thousand
silver marks.</p>

<p>The chivalric spirit, one of the peculiar characteristics of
this war, and of the age in which it was undertaken, kept
up in the hearts of the Crusaders ambition and the love of
glory. In the early days of chivalry, knights declared themselves
the champions of beauty and innocence; at first they
were appealed to for justice against injuries and robberies;
but soon princes and princesses, deprived of their rights by
force, came to demand of them the restitution of provinces
and kingdoms. The champions of misfortune and beauty
then became illustrious liberators and true conquerors.</p>

<p>At the same time that a young prince came to implore
the Crusaders to assist him in replacing his father upon the
throne of Constantinople, a young princess, the daughter of
Isaac, king of Cyprus, despoiled by Richard Cœur de Lion,
repaired to Marseilles, to solicit the support of the Crusaders,
who were embarking for Palestine. She married a
Flemish knight, and charged him with the task of recovering
her father’s kingdom. This Flemish knight, whose name
history does not mention, but who belonged to the family of
Count Baldwin, when he arrived in the East, addressed himself
to the king of Jerusalem, and demanded the kingdom
of Cyprus of him; he was supported in his demand by the
châtelain of Bruges, and the greater part of his companions
who had taken the cross. Amaury, who had received from
the pope and the emperor of Germany, the title of king of
Cyprus, far from yielding to such pretensions, ordered the
Flemish knight, John of Nesle, and their companions, to
quit his dominions. The knights who had embraced the
cause of the daughter of Isaac, abandoned the idea of retaking
the kingdom of Cyprus, and without stopping in the
Holy Land, turned their steps towards the banks of the
Euphrates and the Orontes, to seek for other countries to
conquer.</p>

<p>Before there was a question of attacking Constantinople,
we have seen a daughter of Tancred, the last king of Sicily,
espouse a French knight, and transfer to him the charge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
avenging her family and establishing her claims to the kingdom
founded by the Norman knights. Gauthier de Brienne,
after his marriage, set out for Italy, furnished with a thousand
<i>livres tournois</i>, and accompanied by sixty knights.
Having received at Rome the benediction of the pope, he
declared war against the Germans, then masters of Apulia
and Sicily; got possession of the principal fortresses,<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> and
appeared likely to enjoy the fruits of his victories in peace,
when he was surprised in his tent, and fell, covered with
wounds, into the hands of his enemies. He was offered his
liberty upon the condition of renouncing his claim to the
crown of Sicily; but he preferred the title of king to freedom,
and allowed himself to die with hunger rather than
abandon his rights to a kingdom which victory had bestowed
upon him.</p>

<p>This spirit of conquest, which appeared so general among
the knights, might favour the expedition to Constantinople;
but it was injurious to the holy war, by turning the Crusaders
aside from the essential object of the crusade. The
heroes of this war did nothing for the deliverance of Jerusalem,
of which they constantly spoke in their letters to the
pope. The conquest of Byzantium, very far from being, as
the knights believed, the road to the land of Christ, was but
a new obstacle to the taking of the holy city; their imprudent
exploits placed the Christian colonies in greater peril,
and only ended in completely subverting, without replacing
it, a power which might have served as a barrier against the
Saracens.</p>

<p>The Venetians skilfully took advantage of this disposition
of the French knights; Venice succeeded in stifling the voice
of the sovereign pontiff, who often gave the Crusaders counsels
dictated by the spirit of the gospel. The republic had
the greatest influence over the events of this war, and over
the minds of the barons and knights, who allowed themselves
to be governed by turns by the sentiments of honour and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
by a desire to win rich dominions, and thus exhibited
throughout their conduct an inconsistent mixture of generosity
and avarice.</p>

<p>The inclination to enrich themselves by victory had, particularly,
no longer any bounds when the Crusaders had
once beheld Constantinople; ambition took the place in
their hearts of every generous sentiment, and left nothing
of that enthusiasm which had been the moving principle of
other crusades. No prodigy, no miraculous apparition came
to second or stimulate the valour of knights to whom it was
quite sufficient to point out the wealth of Greece. In preceding
crusades, the bishops and ecclesiastics promised the
combatants indulgences of the Church and eternal life; but
in this war, as the Crusaders had incurred the displeasure of
the head of the faithful, they could not be supported in
their perils by the hope of martyrdom; and the leaders who
were acquainted with the spirit that animated their followers,
contented themselves with offering a sum of money to
the soldier that should first mount the ramparts of Constantinople.
When they had pillaged the city, knights,
barons, and soldiers exclaimed, in the intoxication of their
joy,&mdash;<i>Never was so rich a booty seen since the creation of the
world!</i></p>

<p>We have remarked that, in the conquest of the provinces,
every knight wished to obtain a principality; every count,
every lord, wished for a kingdom; the clergy themselves
were not exempt from this ambition, and often complained
to the pope of not having been favoured in the division of
the spoils of the Greek empire.</p>

<p>To recapitulate, in a few words, our opinion of the events
and consequences of this crusade, we must say that the
spirit of chivalry and the spirit of conquest at first gave
birth to wonders; but that they did not suffice to maintain
the Crusaders in their possessions. This conquering spirit,
carried to the most blind excess, did not allow them to reflect
that among the greatest triumphs, there is a point at which
victory and force themselves are powerless, if prudence and
wisdom do not come to the assistance of valour.</p>

<p>The Franks, their ancestors, who set out from the North
to invade the richest provinces of the Roman empire, were
better seconded by fortune, but more particularly by their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
own genius. Respecting the usages of the countries that
submitted to their arms, they only beheld in the conquered,
fellow-citizens and supporters of their own power; they did
not create a foreign nation in the midst of the nations they
had desolated by their victories. The Crusaders, on the
contrary, evinced a profound contempt for the Greeks, whose
alliance and support they ought to have been anxious to
seek; they wished to reform manners and alter opinions,&mdash;a
much more difficult task than the conquest of an empire,&mdash;and
only met with enemies in a country that might have
furnished them with useful allies.</p>

<p>We may add that the policy of the Holy See, which at
first undertook to divert the Latin warriors from the expedition
to Constantinople, became, in the end, one of the
greatest obstacles to the preservation of their conquests.
The counts and barons, who reproached themselves with
having failed in obedience to the sovereign pontiff, at length
followed scrupulously his instructions to procure by their
arms the submission of the Greek Church, the only condition
on which the holy father would pardon a war commenced in
opposition to his commands. To obtain his forgiveness and
approbation, they employed violence against schism and
heresy, and lost their conquest by endeavouring to justify it
in the eyes of the sovereign pontiff. The pope himself did
not obtain that which he so ardently desired. The union
of the Greek and Roman churches could not possibly be
effected amidst the terrors of victory and the evils of war;
the arms of the conquerors had less power than the anathemas
of the Church, to bring back the Greeks to the worship
of the Latins. Violence only served to irritate men’s minds,
and consummated the rupture, instead of putting an end to
it. The remembrance of persecutions and outrages, a reciprocal
contempt, an implacable hatred arose and became
implanted between the two creeds, and separated them for
ever.</p>

<p>History cannot affirm that this crusade made great progress
in the civilization of Europe. The Greeks had preserved
the jurisprudence of Justinian; the empire possessed
wise regulations upon the levying of imposts and the administration
of the public revenues; but the Latins disdained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
these monuments of human wisdom and of the experience
of many ages; they coveted nothing the Greeks possessed
but their territories and their wealth. Most of the knights
took a pride in their ignorance, and amongst the spoils of
Constantinople, attached no value to the ingenious productions
of Greece. Amidst the conflagrations that consumed
the mansions and palaces of the capital, they beheld with
indifference large and valuable libraries given up to the
flames. It must be confessed, however, that, in these great
disasters the Muses had not to weep for the loss of any of
the masterpieces they had inspired. If the conquerors
knew not how to appreciate the treasures of genius, this
rich deposit was not to be lost for their descendants. All
the books of antiquity that were known in the time of
Eustathius [A. D. 750, <span class="smcap">Trans.</span>], and of which that learned
philosopher made the nomenclature some centuries before
the fifth crusade, enriched France and Italy at the revival of
letters.</p>

<p>We may add that the necessity for both conquerors and
conquered of intercommunication must have contributed to
the spreading of the Latin language among the Greeks, and
that of the Greeks among the Latins.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> The people of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Greece were obliged to learn the idiom of the clergy of
Rome in order to make their petitions and complaints known;
the ecclesiastics charged by the pope to convert the Greeks
could not dispense with the study of the language of Plato
and Demosthenes, to teach the disciples of Photius the
truths of the Roman Catholic religion.</p>

<p>We have spoken of the destruction of the masterpieces
of sculpture; we must admit, nevertheless, that some of
them escaped the barbarism of the conquerors. The Venetians,
more enlightened than the other Crusaders, and born
in a city constructed and embellished by the arts, caused
several of the monuments of Byzantium to be transported
into Italy. Four horses of bronze,<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> which, amidst the revolutions
of empires, had passed from Greece to Rome, from
Rome to Constantinople, were sent to decorate the place of
St. Mark: many ages after this crusade, they were doomed
to be carried away from Venice, in its turn invaded by victorious
armies, and again to return to the shores of the
Adriatic, as eternal trophies of war, and faithful companions
of victory.</p>

<p>The Crusaders likewise profited by several useful inventions,
and transmitted them to their compatriots; and the
fields and gardens of Italy and France were enriched by
some plants till that time unknown in the West. Boniface<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
sent into his marquisate some seeds of maize, which had
never before been cultivated in Italy: a public document,
which still exists, attests the gratitude of the people of
Montferrat. The magistrates received the innocent fruits
of victory with great solemnity, and, upon their altars,
called down a blessing upon a production of Greece, that
would one day constitute the wealth of the plains of Italy.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>Flanders, Champagne, and most of the provinces of
France, which had sent their bravest warriors to the crusade,
fruitlessly lavished their population and their treasures
upon the conquest of Byzantium. We may say that our intrepid
ancestors gained nothing by this wonderful war, but
the glory of having given, for a moment, masters to Constantinople,
and lords to Greece. And yet these distant
conquests, and this new empire, which drew from France its
turbulent and ambitious princes, must have been favourable
to the French monarchy. Philip Augustus must have been
pleased by the absence of the great vassals of the crown, and
had reason to learn with joy that the count of Flanders, a
troublesome neighbour, and a not very submissive vassal,
had obtained an empire in the East. The French monarchy
thus derived some advantage from this crusade; but the republic
of Venice profited much more by it.</p>

<p>This republic, which scarcely possessed a population of
two hundred thousand souls, and had not the power to make
its authority respected on the continent, in the first place,
made use of the arms of the Crusaders, to subdue cities, of
which, without their assistance, she could never have made
herself mistress. By the conquest of Constantinople, she
enlarged her credit and her commerce in the East, and
brought under her laws some of the richest possessions of
the Greek emperors. She increased the reputation of her
navy, and raised herself above all the maritime nations of
Europe. The Venetians, though fighting under the banners
of the cross, never neglected the interests or glory of their
own country, whilst the French knights scarcely ever fought
for any object but personal glory and their own ambition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
The republic of Venice, accustomed to calculate the advantages
and expenses of war, immediately renounced all conquests
the preservation of which might become burdensome
and of her new possessions in the East, only retained such
as she judged necessary to the prosperity of her commerce,
or the maintenance of her marine. Three years after the
taking of Constantinople, the senate of Venice published an
edict, by which it permitted any of the citizens to conquer
the islands of the Archipelago; yielding to them the proprietorship
of all the countries they might subdue. After
this there soon appeared princes of Naxos, dukes of Paros,
and lords of Mycone, as there had been dukes of Athens,
lords of Thebes, and princes of Achaia; but these dukes and
princes were only vassals of the republic. Thus Venice,
more fortunate than France, made the valour and ambition
of her citizens subservient to her interests.</p>

<p class="pc mid">SIXTH CRUSADE.</p>

<p class="pc lmid">A.D. 1200-1215.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">In</span> the preceding books, the imposing spectacle has passed
before our eyes of the fall of an old empire, and of the rise
and rapid decline of a new one. The imagination of man
loves to dwell upon ruins, and the most sanguinary catastrophes
even offer him highly attractive pictures. We have
reason to fear that our narration will create less interest,
awaken less curiosity, when, after the great revolutions we
have described, it will be our duty to turn our attention to
the petty states the Christians founded in Syria, for the
safety of which the nations of the West were constantly
called upon to furnish warlike assistance.</p>

<p>At the present day, we have great difficulty in comprehending
that enthusiasm which animated all classes for the
deliverance of the holy places, or that powerful interest that
directed the thoughts of all to countries almost forgotten by
modern Europe.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> During the height of the fervour for
the crusades, the taking of a city or town of Judea caused
more joy than the taking of Byzantium; and Jerusalem was
more dear to the Christians of the West than their own
country. This enthusiasm, of which our indifference can
scarcely form an idea, renders the task of the historian difficult,
and makes him often hesitate in the choice of the
events that history has to record: when opinions have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
changed, everything has changed with them: glory itself
has lost its splendour, and that which appeared great in the
eyes of men, seems only fantastical or vulgar; the historical
epochs of our annals have become the objects of our most
sovereign contempt; and when, without due reference to
the ages of the holy wars, we wish to submit these extraordinary
enterprises to the calculations of reason, we resemble
those modern travellers who have only found a dribbling
rivulet in the place of that famous Scamander, of which the
imagination of the ancients, and still more, the muse of
Homer, had made a majestic river.</p>

<p>But if we have no longer the task of describing the revolutions
and falls of empires, the epoch of which we are
about to trace the picture, will still present to us but too
many of those great calamities with which human life supplies
history: whilst Greece was a prey to all the ravages
of war, the most cruel scourges desolated both Egypt and
Syria.</p>

<p>The Nile suspended its accustomed course, and failed to
inundate its banks or render the harvests abundant. The
last year of this century (1200) announced itself, says an
Arabian author, like a monster whose fury threatened to devour
everything. When the famine began to be felt, the
people were compelled to support themselves upon the grass
of the fields and the ordure of animals,<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> the poor routed up
cemeteries, and disputed with the worms the spoils of coffins.
When this awful scourge became more general, the population
of the cities and country, as if pursued by a pitiless
enemy, fled away from their homes in despair, and wandered
about at hazard from city to city, from village to village,
meeting everywhere with the evil they wished to avoid; in
no inhabited place could they step a foot without being
struck by the appearance of a putrifying carcass, or some
unhappy wretch on the point of expiring.</p>

<p>The most frightful effect of this universal calamity was,
that the want of food gave birth to the greatest crimes, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
rendered every man the enemy of his fellows. At the commencement
of the famine much horror was expressed at
some being reduced to feed upon human flesh, but examples
of so great a scandal increased with such rapidity, that it
was soon spoken of with indifference. Men contending
with famine, which spared the rich no more than the poor,
were no longer sensible to pity, shame, or remorse, and were
restrained neither by respect for the laws, nor by the fear of
punishment. They came at last to devour each other like
wild beasts. At Cairo, thirty women, in one day, perished
at the stake, convicted of having killed and eaten their own
children. The historian Abdallatif relates a crowd of barbarous
and monstrous incidents which make the blood run
cold with horror, and to which we will not give a place in
our history, for fear of being accused of calumniating
human nature.</p>

<p>The plague soon added its ravages to those of famine.
God alone, says contemporary history, knows the number of
those that died with famine and disease. The capital of
Egypt, in the space of a few months, witnessed a hundred
and eleven thousand funerals. At length it was found impossible
to bury the dead, and the terrified survivors were
obliged to be satisfied with casting them over the ramparts.
The same mortality was experienced at Damietta, Kous, and
Alexandria. It was at the period of seed-time that the
plague was at its height; they who sowed the seed were not
the same that had ploughed the ground, and they who sowed
lived not to reap the harvest. The villages were deserted,
and reminded travellers of those expressions of the Koran:
“<i>We have mown them all down and exterminated them; one
cry was heard, and all have perished.</i>” The dead bodies that
floated on the Nile were as numerous as the bulbous plants
which, at certain seasons, cover the waters of that river.
One fisherman counted more than four hundred that passed
before his eyes in a single day; piles of human bones were
met with everywhere; the roads, to borrow the expression
of Arabian writers, “<i>Were like a field sown with dead
bodies</i>, and the most populous provinces <i>were as a banqueting-hall
for the birds of prey</i>.”</p>

<p>Egypt lost more than a million of its inhabitants; both
famine and plague were felt as far as Syria, and the Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
cities suffered equally with those of the Mussulmans.
From the shores of the Red Sea to the banks of the
Euphrates and the Orontes, the whole country presented
one picture of desolation and mourning. As if the anger of
Heaven was not satisfied, it was not long before a third
calamity, not less terrible, followed in the train of the others.
A violent earthquake laid waste the cities and provinces that
famine and plague had spared;<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> the shocks resembled the
motion of a sieve, or that which a bird makes when he raises
and lowers his wings. The rising of the sea, and the agitation
of the waves presented a horrible appearance; ships
were, on a sudden, carried far on to the land, and multitudes
of fish covered the shore; the heights of Libanus opened
and sunk in many places. The people of Syria and Egypt
believed it to be the earthquake that is to precede the day
of judgment. Many inhabited places totally disappeared;
a vast number of men perished; the fortresses of Hamath,
Barin, and Balbec were thrown down; the only part of the
city of Naplouse that was left standing was the street of the
Samaritans; in Damascus, all the most superb edifices were
destroyed; in the city of Tyre only a few houses escaped,
and the ramparts of Ptolemaïs and Tripoli were nothing but
heaps of ruins. The shocks were felt with less violence in
the territory of Jerusalem, and, in the general calamity, both
Christians and Mussulmans returned thanks to Heaven for
having spared in its anger the city of prophets and miracles.</p>

<p>Such awful disasters ought to have caused the treaties made
between the barons and the infidels to be respected. In the
fifth crusade, the sovereign pontiff urged the Christians to
take advantage of these calamitous days to invade the
Mussulman provinces of Syria and Egypt: but if the advice
of the pope had been followed, if the Christian army on
leaving Venice, had directed its march towards the countries
devastated by pestilence and famine, it is most probable that
the conquerors and the conquered would have perished together.
At that period, death, like a formidable sentinel,
guarded all the frontiers of the Christians and Mussulmans.
All the scourges of nature became the terrible guardians of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
provinces, and defended the approaches and entrances of
cities better than the greatest armies could have done.</p>

<p>The Christian colonies, however, began, not to repair their
losses, but to forget the evils they had suffered. Amaury,
king of Jerusalem, set his barons an example of wisdom and
pious resignation. The three military orders, that had exhausted
their treasures to support their knights and soldiers
during the famine, made a strong appeal, by messengers and
letters, to the charity of the faithful of the West. The
Christian cities that had been destroyed by the earthquake
were rebuilt, and the sums amassed by Foulque of Neuilly,
the preacher of the last crusade, were employed in restoring
the walls of Ptolemaïs. As the Christians wanted labourers,
they set the Mussulman prisoners to work. Among the prisoners
condemned to this service, history must not pass by
the celebrated Persian poet Saadi, who had fallen into the
hands of the Franks, whilst on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>
The author of “The Garden of Roses,” and several other
works, destined at a future day to obtain the admiration of
the East and the West, was loaded with irons, led to Tripoli,
and confounded with the crowd of captives employed in rebuilding
the fortifications of that city.</p>

<p>The truce which had been concluded with the infidels
still subsisted; but either pretensions or quarrels daily
arose that were frequently followed by hostilities. The
Christians were continually kept under arms, and peace was
sometimes as abundant in troubles and dangers as an open
war would have been. There likewise prevailed, at this
time, great confusion among the Christian colonies, and
even among the Mussulman powers. The sultan of Damascus
was at peace with the king of Jerusalem, whilst the
count of Tripoli, the prince of Antioch, with the Templars
and Hospitallers, were at war with the princes of Hamath,
Edessa or some emirs of Syria.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> Every one, according to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
humour, took up or laid down his arms, without any power
being sufficiently strong to enforce respect for treaties.</p>

<p>No great battles were fought, but constant incursions
upon the territories of enemies were made; cities were surprised,
countries were ravaged, and great booty obtained.
Amidst these disorders, which were called <i>Days of Truce</i>,
the Christians of Palestine had to lament the death of their
king. Amaury, according to the custom of the faithful,
went to Caïfa, during holy week, to gather palm; but fell
sick on his pilgrimage, and returned to Ptolemaïs to die.
Thus the sceptre of the kingdom of Jerusalem again remained
in the hands of Isabella, who had neither the power,
nor the ability necessary to govern the Christian states.
At the same time, one of the sons of Bohemond, prince of
Antioch, fell under the daggers of assassins sent by the Old
Man of the Mountains. Bohemond the Third, at a very
advanced age, was unable to avenge this murder; and, in
addition, before he died, had the mortification of seeing war
break out between his second son, Raymond, count of
Tripoli, and Livon, prince of Armenia. The order of the
Templars, as well as that of the Hospitallers, interested
themselves in this quarrel, and were opposed to each other.
The sultan of Aleppo and the Turks from Asia Minor mixed
themselves with the dissensions of the Christians, and took
advantage of their divisions to ravage the territory of Antioch.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>
The Christian states of Syria received no more
succours from the West. The remembrance of the evils
that had ravaged the countries beyond the seas had damped
the zeal and the ardour of pilgrims; the warriors of Europe,
accustomed to face with coolness all the perils of war, had
not sufficient courage to brave pestilence and famine. A
great number of the barons and knights of Palestine, themselves
abandoned a land too long laid desolate, some to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
repair to Constantinople, and others to the kingdoms of the
West.</p>

<p>Innocent, who had up to this time made vain efforts for
the deliverance of the holy places, and who could not overcome
his regret at having seen great Christian armies fruitlessly
dissipated in the conquest of Greece, still did not
give up his vast designs; from the beginning of his reign,
the sovereign pontiff had pointed out the Holy Land to the
Christian nations, as the road and the way of salvation.
After the example of his predecessors, he not only called
piety and virtue in to the defence of the Christian colonies,
but remorse and repentance. All who came to him to confess
great sins, were allowed but one means of expiating
their crimes,&mdash;crossing the sea to fight against the infidels.</p>

<p>Among the sinners condemned to this sort of punishment
history quotes the names of the murderers of Conrad, bishop
of Wurtzburg and chancellor of the empire.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> The guilty
having presented themselves before the pope, barefooted,
in drawers, and with halters round their necks, swore in the
presence of the cardinals, to pass their lives in the practice
of the most austere mortifications, and to carry arms during
four years against the Saracens. A knight, named Robert,
scandalized the whole court of Rome by confessing in a loud
voice, that, being a prisoner in Egypt during the famine, he
had killed his wife and daughter, to feed upon their flesh.
The pope imposed the most rigorous penances upon Robert,
and ordered him, to complete the expiation of so great a
crime, to pass three years in visiting the holy places.</p>

<p>Innocent endeavoured by such means to keep up the
devotion of pilgrimages, which had given birth to the crusades,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
and might again revive the zeal and ardour for holy wars.
According to the opinion which the sovereign pontiff
sought to spread among the faithful, and by which he himself
appeared penetrated, this corrupt world had no crimes
for which God would not open the treasures of his mercy
provided the perpetrators would take the voyage to the
East. The people however were persuaded that the sins
and errors of a perverse generation had irritated the God of
the Christians, and that the glory of conquering the Holy
Land was reserved for another and a better age, to a generation
more worthy of attracting the eyes and the blessings
of Heaven.</p>

<p>This opinion of the nations of the West was very little in
favour of the Christians of Syria, who were daily making
rapid strides towards their fall. Isabella, who only reigned
over depopulated cities, died soon after her husband. A
son that she had had by Amaury preceded her to the tomb;
and the kingdom of Jerusalem became the heritage of a
young princess, a daughter of Isabella and Conrad, marquis
of Tyre. The barons and knights that remained in Syria
were more sensible than ever of the necessity of having at
their head a prince able to govern them, and immediately
set about choosing a husband for the young queen of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Their choice might have fallen upon one of themselves;
but they feared that jealousy would give birth to fresh discords,
and that the spirit of rivalry and faction would weaken
the authority of him that should be called upon to govern
the kingdom. The assembly resolved to seek a king in the
West, and to address themselves to the country of Godfrey
and the Baldwins,&mdash;to that nation that had furnished so
many heroes to the crusades, so many illustrious defenders
of the Holy Land.</p>

<p>This resolution of the barons of Palestine had not only
the advantage of preserving peace in the kingdom of Jerusalem,
but also that of arousing the spirit of chivalry in
Europe, and of interesting it in the cause of the Christians
of the East. Aimar, lord of Cæsarea, and the bishop of
Ptolemaïs, crossed the sea, and went, in the name of the
Christians of the Holy Land, to solicit Philip Augustus to
send them a knight or a baron who might save the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
that remained of the unfortunate kingdom of Jerusalem.
The hand of a young queen, a crown, and the blessings of
Heaven were the rewards held out to the bravery and devotedness
of him who was willing to fight for the heritage
of the Son of God. The deputies were received with great
honours at the court of the king of France. Although
the crown they offered was nothing but a vain title, it not
the less dazzled the imagination of the French knights;
their valorous ambition was seduced by the hope of acquiring
great renown, and restoring the throne that had been
founded by the bravery of Godfrey of Bouillon.</p>

<p>Among the knights of his court, Philip greatly distinguished
John of Brienne,<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> brother of Gauthier,<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> who died
in Apulia with the reputation of a hero and the title of
king. In his youth, John of Brienne had been destined for
the ecclesiastical state; but, brought up in a family of warriors,
and less sensible to the charms of piety than to those
of glory, he refused to obey the will of his parents; and as
his father was inclined to employ force to constrain him, he
sought a refuge against paternal anger in the monastery of
Citeaux. John of Brienne was mixed with the crowd of
cenobites, and gave himself up, as they did, to fasting and
mortification. The austerities of the cloister, however,
did not at all assimilate with his growing passion for the
noble occupation of arms; and often, amidst prayers and
religious ceremonies, the images of tournaments and battles
would distract his thoughts and disturb his mind. One of
his uncles having found him at the door of the monastery
in a state very little suited to a gentleman, had pity on his
tears, took him away with him, and encouraged his natural
inclinations. From that time the glory of combats entirely
occupied his thoughts; and he who had been destined to
the silence of cloisters and the peace of altars, was not long
in creating for himself by his bravery and exploits a great
and widely spread renown.</p>

<p>At the period of the last crusade, John of Brienne accompanied
his brother in his attempt to obtain the kingdom of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Naples, and saw him perish whilst fighting for a throne that
was to be the reward of the victor. He had the same fortune
to guide his hopes, and the same dangers to encounter,
if he espoused the heir of the kingdom of Jerusalem. He
accepted with joy the hand of a young queen, for the possession
of whose states he must contend with the Saracens,
he charged the ambassadors to return and announce his
speedy arrival in Palestine, and, full of confidence in the
cause he was about to defend, promised to follow them at
the head of an army.</p>

<p>When Aymar of Cæsarea and the bishop of Ptolemaïs
returned to the Holy Land, the promises of John of Brienne
raised the depressed courage of the Christians, and, as it
often happens in seasons of misfortune, they passed from
despair to the most extravagant hopes.</p>

<p>It was given out in Palestine that a crusade was in preparation,
commanded by the most powerful monarchs of the
West; and the report of such an extraordinary armament
produced a momentary terror among the infidels. Malek-Adel,
who, since the death of Al-Aziz, reigned over Syria
and Egypt, dreaded the enterprises of the Christians; and
as the truce made with the Franks was on the point of expiring,
he proposed to renew it, offering to deliver up ten
castles or fortresses as a pledge of his good faith and his
desire for a continuation of peace. This proposal ought to
have been welcomed by the Christians of Palestine; but the
hopes of assistance from the West had banished all moderation
and foresight from the councils of the barons and
knights. The wiser part of the Christian warriors, among
whom was the grand master of the order of St. John, were
of opinion that the truce should be prolonged. They reminded
their companions that they had often been promised
succour from the West, without this succour ever having
reached the Holy Land; and that in the very last crusade,
a formidable army, confidently expected in Palestine, had
directed its march towards Constantinople. They added,
that it was not prudent to risk the chances of war upon the
faith of a vain promise; and that they ought to wait the
event, before they formed a determination upon which might
depend the safety or the ruin of the Christians of the East.
These discourses were full of wisdom and good sense, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
as the Hospitallers spoke in favour of the truce, the Templars,
with great warmth, declared for war: such was, likewise,
the spirit of the Christian warriors, that prudence,
moderation, or, indeed, any of the virtues of peace, inspired
them with a sort of disdain; for them reason was always
on the side of perils, and only to speak of flying to arms
was quite sufficient to win all their suffrages. The assembly
of barons and knights refused to prolong the truce made
with the Saracens.</p>

<p>This determination became so much the more fatal, from
the situation of France and Europe, which could scarcely
allow John of Brienne to entertain the hope of accomplishing
his promise of raising an army for the Holy Land.</p>

<p>Germany was still agitated by the rival pretensions of
Otho and Philip of Swabia: John of England laboured
under the curse of an excommunication, which interdict
extended to his kingdom. Philip Augustus was busily employed
in taking advantage of all the troubles that were in
full action around him; on one side by endeavouring to extend
his influence in Germany, and on the other by constant
efforts to weaken the power of the English, who were masters
of several provinces of his kingdom. John of Brienne
arrived at Ptolemaïs with the train of a king, but he only
brought with him three hundred knights to defend his kingdom;
his new subjects, however, still full of hopes, looked
upon him no less as a liberator. His marriage was celebrated
in the presence of the barons, the princes, and the
bishops of Ptolemaïs. As the truce was about to expire,
the Saracens resumed their arms, and disturbed the festivities
of the coronation. Malek-Adel entered Palestine at
the head of an army, and the infidels not only laid siege to
Tripoli, but threatened Ptolemaïs.</p>

<p>The new king, at the head of a small number of faithful
warriors, created great admiration for his valour in the field
of battle; but he was not able to deliver the Christian provinces
from the presence of a formidable enemy. When
the defenders of Palestine compared their scanty ranks
with the multitude of their enemies, they sank at once into
a state of despondency; and even those who so lately
scorned the thoughts of peace with the infidels, could not
muster either strength or courage to oppose to their attacks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Most of the French knights that had accompanied the new
king, quitted the kingdom they had come to succour, and
returned into Europe. The dominions of John of Brienne
consisted of the city of Ptolemaïs alone, and he had no
army to defend even that; he then began to perceive he had
undertaken a perilous and difficult task, and that he should
not be able to contend for any length of time against the
united forces of the Saracens. Ambassadors were sent to
Rome to inform the pope of the pressing dangers of the
Christian states in Asia, and once more to implore the support
of the princes of Europe, and, above all, of the French
knights.</p>

<p>These fresh cries of alarm were scarcely heard by the
nations of the West. The troubles which agitated Europe
at the period of the departure of John of Brienne for Palestine
were far from being allayed, and prevented France
especially from lending any assistance to the Christian colonies.
Languedoc and most of the southern provinces of the
kingdom were then desolated by religious wars, which fully
employed the bravery of the French knights and nobles.</p>

<p>A spirit of inquiry and indocility, which had arisen among
the faithful, and with which St. Bernard had reproached his
age, was making alarming progress every day. The most
holy doctors had already many times expressed their grief
at the abasement of the holy word, of which every one constituted
himself judge and arbiter, and which was treated,
said Stephen of Tournay in his letters to the pope, with as
little discernment as <i>holy things given to dogs, or pearls cast
at the feet of swine</i>. This spirit of independence and pride,
joined to the love of paradox and novelty; to the decline of
sound studies, and the relaxation of ecclesiastical discipline;
had given birth to heresies which rent the bosom of the
Church.</p>

<p>The most dangerous of all the new sects was that of the
Albigeois,<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> which took its name from the city of Albi, in
which its first assemblies had been held. These new sectarians
being unable to explain the existence of evil under a
just and good God, as the Manicheans had done, adopted
two principles. According to their belief, God had first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
created Lucifer and his angels; Lucifer having revolted
from God, was banished from heaven, and produced the
visible world, over which he reigned. God, to re-establish
order, created his second son, Jesus Christ, to be the genius
of good, as Lucifer had been the genius of evil. Several
contemporary writers represent the Albigeois in the most
odious colours, and describe them as given up to all kinds of
error; but this opinion must not be adopted in all its rigour
by impartial history. For the honour of human nature we
feel bound to say, that never did a religious sect dare to
endeavour to win the approbation of mankind whilst presenting
an example of depravity of morals; and that in no
age, among no people, has a false doctrine ever been able to
lead astray any number of men, without being supported by
at least an appearance of virtue.</p>

<p>The wisest and most earnest Christians were at that
period desirous of a reform in the clergy. “But there
were,” says Bossuet, “vain and proud minds,<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> full of bitterness,
which, struck by the disorders that reigned in the
Church, and more particularly among its ministers, did not
believe that the promises of its eternal duration could
possibly subsist amongst these abuses. These, become
proud, and thence weak, yielded to the temptation which
leads to a hatred of the Church from a hatred of those who
preside in it; and as if the malice of man could annihilate
the work of God, the aversion they had conceived for the
teachers, made them hate at the same time both the doctrine
they taught and the authority they had received from God.”</p>

<p>This disposition of men’s minds gave the apostles of error
a most deplorable ascendancy, and multiplied the number of
their disciples. Among the new sectarians, the most remarkable
were the <i>Vaudois</i>, or <i>Poor of Lyons</i>, who devoted themselves
to a state of idle poverty, and despised the clergy,
whom they accused of living in luxury and voluptuousness;
the <i>Apostoliques</i>, who boasted of being the only mystical
body of Jesus Christ; the <i>Popelicains</i>, who abhorred the
eucharist, marriages, and the other sacraments; the <i>Aymeristes</i>,
whose teachers announced to the world the future<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
establishment of a purely spiritual worship, and denied the
existence of a hell or a paradise, persuaded that sin finds in
itself its own punishment, and virtue its own reward.</p>

<p>As the greater part of these heretics exhibited a sovereign
contempt for the authority of the Church, which was then
the first of all authorities, all those who wished to shake off
the yoke of divine laws, and those even to whom their passions
rendered the restraint of human laws intolerable, came
at length to range themselves under the banners of these
innovators, and were welcomed by a sect anxious to increase
and strengthen itself, and always disposed to consider as its
partisans and defenders, men whom society cast from its
bosom, who dreaded justice, and could not endure established
order. Thus the pretended reformers of the thirteenth
century, whilst themselves affecting austerity of manners,
and proclaiming the triumph of virtue and truth, admitted
into their bosom both corruption and licentiousness, destroyed
every regulation of authority, abandoned everything
to the caprice of the passions, and left no bond to society,
no power to morals, no check upon the multitude.</p>

<p>The new heresies had been condemned in several councils;
but as violence was sometimes employed in executing the
decisions of the Church, persecution only tended to sour
men’s minds, instead of bringing them back to truth. Missionaries
and papal legates were sent into Languedoc, to
convert the misled wanderers from the flock; but their
preaching produced no fruit, and the voice of falsehood
prevailed over the word of God. The preachers of the faith,
whom the heretics reproached with their luxury, their ignorance,
and the depravity of their manners, had neither
sufficient resignation nor sufficient humility to support such
outrages, or offer them as a sacrifice to Jesus Christ, whose
apostles they were. Exposed to the scoffs of the sectarians,
and gathering nothing from the labours of their missions but
humiliation and contempt, they accustomed themselves to
view the people they were sent to convert as personal enemies;
and a spirit of vengeance and pride, which certainly
came not from heaven, made them believe it was their duty
to bring into the right road, by force of arms, all who had
denied their power or resisted their eloquence. The sovereign
pontiff, whose mind was constantly bent upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Asiatic war, hesitated at ordering a crusade to be preached
against the Albigeois; but he was led away by the opinions
of the clergy, perhaps also by that of his age, and at last
promised to all Christians who would take up arms against
the Albigeois the same privileges as those granted to the
Crusaders against the Saracens.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> Simon de Montfort, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
duke of Burgundy, and the duke of Nevers obeyed the orders
of the Holy See: the hatred which this new sect inspired,
but still more the facility of gaining indulgences from the
sovereign pontiff without quitting Europe, drew a great
number of warriors to the standards of this crusade. The
Inquisition owes its birth to this war; an institution at once
fatal to humanity, religion, and patriotism. Piles and stakes
appeared on all sides, cities were taken by storm, and their
inhabitants put to the sword. The violences and cruelties
which accompanied this unfortunate war have been described
by those even who took a most active part in them;<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> their
recitals, which we have great difficulty in believing, frequently
resemble the language of falsehood and exaggeration.
In periods of vertigo and fury, when violent passions
come in to mislead both opinions and consciences, it is not
rare to meet with men who exaggerate the excesses to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
they have given themselves up, and boast of more evil than
they have committed.</p>

<p>For ourselves, the disastrous war against the Albigeois
does not enter into the plan of this history, and if we have
spoken of it here, it was only the better to describe the
situation of France at this period, and the obstacles which
then opposed themselves to all enterprises beyond sea.
Amidst these constantly increasing obstacles, Innocent III.
was deeply afflicted at not being able to send succours to
the Christians of Palestine, his regret being the greater
from the circumstance that at the very time the Albigeois
and the count of Thoulouse were subjected to this frightful
crusade, the Saracens were becoming more formidable in
Spain. The king of Castile, threatened by an innumerable
army, had just called upon all Frenchmen able to bear arms
to come to his assistance. The pope himself had written to
all the bishops of France, recommending them to exhort the
faithful of their dioceses to assist in a great battle which was
to be fought between the Spaniards and the Moors, about
the octave of Pentecost (1212). Innocent promised the
warriors who would repair to Spain, the usual indulgences of
holy wars; and a solemn procession was made at Rome, to
implore of God the destruction of the Moors and Saracens.
The archbishops of Narbonne and Bordeaux, the bishop of
Nantes, and a great number of French nobles, crossed the
Pyrenees, followed by two thousand knights with their
squires and serjeants-at-arms. The Christian army met the
Moors in the plains of Las Navas de Tolosa, and fought a
battle, in which more than two hundred thousand infidels lost
either their lives or their liberty. The conquerors, loaded
with spoils and surrounded by the dead, sang the <i>Te Deum</i>
on the field of battle: the standard of the leader of the
Almoades was sent to Rome as a trophy of the victory
granted to the prayers of the Christian Church.</p>

<p>On learning the issue of the battle of Tolosa, the sovereign
pontiff, amidst the assembled inhabitants of Rome, offered
up thanks to God for having scattered the enemies of his
people, and at the same time prayed that Heaven in its
mercy would, in the end, deliver the Christians of Syria as
it had just delivered the Christians of Spain.</p>

<p>The head of the Church renewed his exhortations to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
faithful for the defence of the kingdom of Jesus Christ; but
amidst the troubles and civil wars that he himself had excited,
he could gain no attention to the complaints of Jerusalem,
and shed tears of despair at the indifference of the
nations of the West. About this period such a circumstance
was beheld as had never occurred even in times so abounding
in prodigies and extraordinary events. Fifty thousand
children, in France and Germany, braving paternal authority,
gathered together and pervaded both cities and countries,
singing these words:&mdash;“Lord Jesus, restore to us your holy
cross!” When they were asked whither they were going,
or what they intended to do, they replied, “We are going
to Jerusalem, to deliver the sepulchre of our Saviour.”
Some ecclesiastics, blinded by false zeal, had preached this
crusade; most of the faithful saw nothing in it but the
inspiration of Heaven, and thought that Jesus Christ, to
show his divine power, and to confound the pride of the
greatest captains, and of the wise and powerful of the earth,
had placed his cause in the hands of simple and timid infancy.</p>

<p>Many women of bad character, and dishonest men insinuated
themselves amongst the crowd of these new soldiers of
the cross, to seduce and plunder them. A great portion of
this juvenile militia crossed the Alps, to embark at the Italian
ports; whilst those who came from the provinces of France,
directed their course to Marseilles. On the faith of a
miraculous revelation, they had been made to believe that
this year (1213) the drought would be so great that the
sun would dissipate all the waters of the sea, and thus an
easy road for pilgrims would be opened across the bed of
the Mediterranean to the coasts of Syria. Many of these
young Crusaders lost themselves in forests, then so abundant
and large, and wandering about at hazard, perished with
heat, hunger, thirst, and fatigue; others returned to their
homes, ashamed of their imprudence, saying, <i>they really did
not know why they had gone</i>. Among those that embarked,
some were shipwrecked, or given up to the Saracens, against
whom they had set out to fight; many, say the old chronicles,
gathered the palms of martyrdom, and offered the
infidels the edifying spectacle of the firmness and courage
the Christian religion is capable of inspiring at the most
tender age as well as at the more mature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>Such of these children as reached Ptolemais must have
created terror as well as astonishment, by making the Christians
of the East believe that Europe had no longer any
government or laws, no longer any wise or prudent men,
either in the councils of princes or those of the Church.
Nothing more completely demonstrates the spirit of these
times than the indifference with which such disorders were
witnessed. No authority interfered, either to stop or prevent
the madness; and when it was announced to the pope
that death had swept away the flower of the youth of France
and Germany, he contented himself with saying,&mdash;“These
children reproach us with having fallen asleep, whilst they
were flying to the assistance of the Holy Land.”<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>The sovereign pontiff, in order to accomplish his designs,
and rekindle the enthusiasm of the faithful, found it necessary
to strike the imagination of the nations vividly, and to
present a grand spectacle to the Christian world. Innocent
resolved to assemble a general council at Rome, to deliberate
upon the state of the Church and the fate of the Christians
of the East. “The necessity for succouring the Holy
Land,” said he in his letters of convocation, “and the hope
of conquering the Saracens, are greater than ever; we renew
our cries and our prayers to you, to excite you to this noble
enterprise. No one can imagine,” added Innocent, “that
God has need of your arms to deliver Jerusalem; but he
offers you an opportunity of showing your penitence, and
proving your love for him. Oh, my brethren, how many
advantages has not the Christian Church already derived
from the scourges that have desolated her, and desolate her
still! How many crimes have been expiated by repentance!
How many virtues revive at the fire of charity! How many
conversions are made among sinners by the complaining
voice of Jerusalem! Bless, then, the ingenious mercy, the
generous artifice of Jesus Christ, who seeks to touch your
hearts, to seduce your piety, and is willing to owe to his misled
disciples a victory which he holds in his all-powerful hand.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>The pope afterwards compares Jesus Christ banished from
his heritage, to one of the kings of the earth who might be
driven from his dominions. “Where are the vassals,”
added he, “who will not risk their fortunes and their lives
to restore their sovereign to his kingdom? Such of the
subjects and servants of the monarch as shall have done
nothing for his cause, ought they not to be ranked with the
rebels, and be subjected to the punishment due to revolt and
treason? It is thus that Jesus Christ will treat those who
remain indifferent to the insults heaped upon him, and refuse
to take up arms to fight against his enemies.”</p>

<p>To raise the hopes and the courage of the Christians, the
holy father terminated his exhortation to the faithful, by
saying, that “the power of Mahomet drew towards its end;
for that power was nothing but the beast of the Apocalypse,
which was not to extend beyond the number of six hundred
years,<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> and already six centuries were accomplished.” These
last words of the pope were sustained by the popular predictions
which were spread throughout the West, and
created a belief that the destruction of the Saracens was at
hand.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>As in preceding crusades, the sovereign pontiff promised
all who should take arms against the infidels, the remission
of their sins and the especial protection of the Church.
Upon so important an occasion, the head of the Christians
laid open the treasures of divine mercy to all the faithful, in
proportion to their zeal and their gifts. All prelates and
ecclesiastics, as well as the inhabitants of cities and countries,
were invited to raise a certain number of warriors, and
support them for three years, according to their means. The
pope exhorted princes and nobles who would not take the
cross, to second the zeal of the Crusaders in every way in
their power; the head of the Church demanded of all the
faithful, prayers; of the rich, alms and tributes; of knights,
an example of courage; of maritime cities, vessels; he himself
engaging to make the greatest sacrifices. Processions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
were to be made every month in all parishes, in order to
obtain the benedictions of Heaven; all the efforts, all the
vows, all the thoughts of Christians were to be directed
towards the object of the holy war. That nothing might
divert the faithful from the expedition against the Saracens,
the Holy See revoked the indulgences granted to those who
abandoned their homes to go and fight against the Albigeois
in Languedoc, or the Moors on the other side of the
Pyrenees.</p>

<p>It is plain that the sovereign pontiff neglected nothing
that could render the success of the holy enterprise more
certain. A modern historian justly remarks, that he employed
every means, even such as were not likely to succeed;
for he wrote to the sultan of Damascus and Cairo,
inviting him to replace the holy city in the hands of the
servants of the true God. Innocent said in his letter, that
God had chosen the infidels as his instruments of vengeance;
that he had permitted Saladin to get possession of Jerusalem,
in order to punish the sins of the Christians; but that the
day of deliverance was come, and that the Lord, disarmed
by the prayers of his people, was about to restore the heritage
of Jesus Christ. The sovereign pontiff counselled the sultan
to avoid the effusion of blood, and prevent the desolation of
his empire.</p>

<p>This was not the first time that the head of the Church
had addressed prayers and warnings to the Mussulman
powers. Two years before he had written to the sultan of
Aleppo, in the hope of bringing him back to the way of
evangelical truth, and making him a faithful auxiliary of the
Christians. All these attempts, which ended in nothing,
clearly prove that the pope was perfectly unacquainted with
the spirit and character of the Mussulmans. The sovereign
pontiff was not more fortunate when, in his letters, he desired
the patriarch of Jerusalem to use his utmost endeavours
to arrest the progress of corruption and licentiousness
among the Christians of Palestine. The Christians of Syria
made no change in their morals, and all the passions maintained
their reign amongst them; whilst the Mussulmans
fortified the holy city that was demanded of them, and
employed themselves in arming against the attacks of the
enemies of Islamism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing could exceed the ardour and activity of the sovereign
pontiff. History can scarcely follow him, whilst seeking
in every direction enemies against the Mussulmans;
appealing, by turns, to the patriarchs of Alexandria and Antioch,
and to all the princes of Armenia and Syria. His
eye took in at one view both East and West. His letters
and ambassadors passed unceasingly throughout Europe.
He sent the convocation for the council and the bull of the
crusade into all the provinces of Christendom; and his
apostolic exhortations resounded from the shores of the
Danube and the Vistula to the banks of the Tigris and the
Thames.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>Commissaries were chosen to make the decisions of the
Holy See known to all Christians: their mission was to
preach the holy war, and reform manners; to invoke at the
same time the knowledge of the learned and the courage of
warriors. In many provinces, the mission of preaching the
crusade was confided to the bishops; Cardinal Peter Robert
de Courçon, who was then in France, as legate of the pope,
received great powers from the Holy See; and travelled
through the kingdom, exhorting Christians to take up the
cross and arms.</p>

<p>The cardinal de Courçon had been in his youth the disciple
of Foulke of Neuilly, and had gained great celebrity
by his eloquence. The multitude flocked from all parts to
hear so distinguished a preacher of the Word, clothed in all
the splendour of Romish power. “The legate,” says Fleury,
“had the power of regulating everything that was connected
with tournaments; and, which will appear more singular,
the faculty of granting a certain indulgence to those who
were present at the sermons in which he preached the crusade.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>”
Faithful to the spirit of the religion of Jesus Christ,
the cardinal de Courçon gave the cross to all Christians
who asked for it, without reflecting that women, children,
old men, the deaf, the blind, the lame, could not make war
against the Saracens; or that an army could not be formed
as the Gospel composed the feast of the father of the family.
Thus this liberty of entering into the holy bands, accorded
without distinction or choice, only disgusted the barons and
knights, and cooled the ardour of the common soldiers.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p>Among the orators whom the pope associated with the
cardinal de Courçon, one of the most remarkable was James
of Vitri, whom the Church had already placed in the rank
of its celebrated doctors. Whilst he preached the crusade
in the different provinces of France,<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> the fame of his virtues
and talents extended even to the East. The canons of
Ptolemaïs demanded him of the pope as their pastor and
bishop; and the wishes of the Christians of Palestine
were immediately granted. James of Vitri, after having
excited the warriors of the West to take arms, became
afterwards a witness of their labours, and related them in a
history which has come down to our times.</p>

<p>The preaching of the holy war awakened everywhere the
charity of the faithful. Philip Augustus gave up the
fortieth part of his territorial revenues towards the expenses
of the crusade, and a great number of nobles and prelates
followed his example.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> As boxes had been placed in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
churches to receive the alms of the charitable, these alms
brought considerable sums into the hands of the cardinal
de Courçon, who was accused of having appropriated to
himself the gifts offered to Jesus Christ. These accusations
were the more eagerly received, from the legate having taken
upon him to exercise, in the name of the Holy See, an
authority which was displeasing to both the monarch and
his people. The cardinal, without the approbation of the
king, levied taxes, enrolled warriors, forgave debts, lavished
both rewards and punishments, and, in a word, usurped all
the prerogatives of sovereignty. The exercise of such an
unbounded power was the cause of trouble to all the provinces.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>
To prevent disorders, Philip Augustus thought it
necessary to lay down regulations which should specify to
the general council, the individual position of the Crusaders,
and the exemptions and privileges they were to enjoy.</p>

<p>Whilst the cardinal de Courçon continued to preach the
crusade throughout the provinces of France, the archbishop
of Canterbury was earnestly engaged in inciting the people
of England to take up arms against the infidels. During a
length of time, the kingdom of England had been troubled
by the violent contentions of the commons, the barons, and
even the clergy, who had taken advantage of the excommunications<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>
launched by the pope against King John, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
obtain a confirmation of their liberties. The English monarch,
when subscribing the conditions that had been dictated
to him, had yielded much more to necessity and force, than
to his own inclinations; he wished earnestly to retract what
he had granted, and in order to place his crown under the
protection of the Church, he took the cross, and swore to go
and fight against the Saracens. The sovereign pontiff placed
faith in the submission and promises of the king of England;
and after having preached a crusade against this prince,
whom he accused of being an enemy of the Church, he employed
the whole authority of the Holy See, and all the
thunders of religion in his defence.</p>

<p>King John had no other motive in taking the cross but to
deceive the pope, and obtain the protection of the Church;
the sign of the Crusaders was assumed by him only as a
means of preserving his power; a false and deceitful policy,
which was soon unmasked, and, without doubt, assisted
much in diminishing the public enthusiasm for the holy war.
The barons of England, in their turn excommunicated by
the pope, employed themselves in defending their liberties,
and paid no attention to the holy orators who called upon
them to embark for Asia.</p>

<p>The empire of Germany was not less disturbed than the
kingdom of England. Otho of Saxony, after having been,
during ten years, the object of all the predilections of the
Holy See, drew upon himself all at once the implacable
hatred of Innocent, by putting forth some claims to certain
domains of the Church, and to the kingdom of Naples and
Sicily. Not only was he himself excommunicated, but the
cities even that remained faithful to him were placed under
an interdict. The sovereign pontiff opposed Frederick II.,
son of Henry VI., to Otho, in the same manner as he had
opposed Otho to Philip of Swabia. Germany and Italy
were immediately in a state of agitation and trouble.
Frederick, who was crowned king of the Romans at Aix la
Chapelle, took the cross, from a sentiment of gratitude, and
with the hope of securing the support of the Holy See in
ascending the imperial throne.</p>

<p>Otho meanwhile neglected no means of preserving the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
empire, and resisting the views and undertakings of the
court of Rome. He made war against the pope, and allied
himself with all the enemies of Philip Augustus, who had
declared for Frederick. A formidable league, composed of
the king of England and the counts of Flanders, Holland,
and Boulogne, threatened France with an invasion. The
capital and provinces of that kingdom were already shared
among the leaders of this league, when Philip gained the
celebrated battle of Bouvines. This memorable victory<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>
secured the independence and honour of the French monarchy,
and restored peace to Europe. Otho, conquered,
lost his allies, and sunk beneath the thunders of the
Church.</p>

<p>The period was now arrived at which the council summoned
by the pope was to meet. From all parts of Europe,
ecclesiastics, nobles, princes, and the ambassadors of princes,
repaired to the capital of the Christian world. The deputies
from Antioch and Alexandria, with the patriarchs of Constantinople
and Jerusalem, came to Rome to implore the
support of the nations of Christendom; the ambassadors of
Frederick, Philip Augustus, and the kings of England and
Hungary, in the names of their sovereigns, came to take
their places in the council. This assembly, which represented
the universal Church, and in which were nearly five
hundred bishops and archbishops, and more than a hundred
abbots and prelates from all the provinces of the East and
West, took place in the church of the Lateran,<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> and was
presided over by the sovereign pontiff. Innocent opened
the council by a sermon, in which he deplored the errors of
his age and the misfortunes of the Church. After having
exhorted the clergy and the faithful, to sanctify by their
morals, the measures he was about to take against heretics
and the Saracens, he represented Jerusalem as clothed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
mourning, exhibiting the chains of her captivity, and calling
upon all the prophets to lend their voices to reach the hearts
of the Christians.</p>

<p>“Oh! ye,” said Jerusalem by the mouth of the pontiff, “who
pass along the public roads, behold, and see if ye have ever
witnessed grief like mine. Hasten then all, O ye that love
me, to deliver me from the depth of my miseries! I, who
was the queen of all nations, am now subjected to a tribute;
I, who was formerly filled with people, am now left desolate
and almost alone! The roads of Sion mourn, because
no one comes to my solemnities. My enemies have crushed
down my head; all my sacred places are profaned; the Holy
Sepulchre, once so splendid, is covered with disgrace; there,
where of late the Son of God was adored, worship is now
offered up to the son of perdition and hell. The children
of the stranger load me with outrages, and, pointing to the
cross of Jesus, say to me, <i>Thou hast placed thy trust in vile
wood; we shall see whether this wood can save thee in the
hour of danger</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>Innocent after having thus made the mourning Jerusalem
eloquent, conjured the faithful to take pity on her misfortunes,
and arm for her deliverance. He terminated his exhortation
by these words, which breathe both his grief and
his ardent zeal:&mdash;“My beloved brethren, I give myself up
entirely to you; if you think it best, I promise to go in
person with the kings, princes, and nations; you shall see if,
by my cries and my prayers, I shall be able to excite them
to fight for the Lord, to avenge the insults of the crucified,
whom our sins have banished from the land wetted with his
blood, and sanctified with the mystery of our redemption.”</p>

<p>The discourse of the pontiff was listened to in religious
silence; but as Innocent spoke of several objects at the
same time, and as his oratory was full of allegories, he did not
at all succeed in awakening the enthusiasm of the assembly.
The fathers of the council appeared to be not less affected
by the abuses introduced into the Church, than by the reverses
of the Christians of the East; in the first place the
assembly employed itself in endeavouring to find means to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
reform ecclesiastical discipline, and check the progress of
heresy.</p>

<p>In a declaration of faith, the council explained the doctrine
of Christians, and recalled to their minds the symbol
of evangelical belief. They opposed truth to error,
persuasion to violence, and the virtues of the Gospel to the
passions of sectarians and innovators: happy would it then
have been for the Christian church, if the pope had followed
this example of moderation; and if, whilst defending the
rights of religion, he had not forgotten the rights of sovereigns
and humanity. By an apostolic decree, proclaimed
amidst the council, Innocent deposed the count of Thoulouse,
who was considered the protector of heresy, and gave
his states to Simon de Montfort, who had fought against, or
rather slaughtered the Albigeois.</p>

<p>Innocent could not pardon the count of Thoulouse for
having provoked a war which had agitated Christendom, and
suspended the execution of his designs for the Eastern crusade.
The violent policy of the sovereign pontiff aimed at
striking terror into all heretics, and encouraging Christians
to arm for the cause of Jesus Christ and that of his vicar
upon earth.</p>

<p>After having condemned the new errors, and pronounced
the anathemas of the Church against all who strayed from
the way of the faith, the pontiff and the fathers of the
council gave their attention to the Christians of the East,
and the means of promptly succouring the Holy Land. All
the dispositions expressed in the bull of convocation were
confirmed; it was decreed that all ecclesiastics should pay
the twentieth of their revenues towards the expenses of the
crusade; that the pope and the cardinals should pay the
tenth of theirs, and that there should be a truce of four
years among all Christian princes. The council launched
the thunders of excommunication against all princes that
should molest the march of pilgrims, and against all that
should furnish infidels with provisions or arms: the sovereign
pontiff promised to direct the preparations for the
war, to contribute three thousand silver marks and to supply,
at his own expense, several vessels for the transport of
the Crusaders.</p>

<p>The decisions of the council and the speeches of the pope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
made a profound impression upon the minds of the western
Christians. All the preachers of the holy war were formally
directed to recall the faithful to a sense of penitence, and
to prohibit dances, tournaments, and public sports; to reform
morals and to revive in all hearts the love of religion
and virtue. They were commanded, after the example of
the sovereign pontiff, to make the complaints of Jerusalem
resound in the palaces of princes; and to earnestly solicit
monarchs and nobles to assume the cross, so that the people
might be induced to do so likewise.</p>

<p>The decrees concerning the holy wars were published in all
the churches of the West; in several provinces, particularly
in the north, of Europe, the prodigies and miraculous apparitions
that had excited enthusiasm at the period of the first
crusades, again became common; luminous crosses appeared
in the heavens, and made the inhabitants of Cologne and
the cities in the vicinity of the Rhine believe that God
favoured the holy enterprise, and that the divine power promised
the defeat and ruin of the infidels to the arms of the
Crusaders.</p>

<p>The orators redoubled their ardour and zeal to engage
the faithful to take a part in the holy war. From the
pulpits imprecations were poured forth against the Saracens,
always accompanied by a repetition of the words of Christ:
“I am come to establish war.” The eloquence of prelates,
bishops, and pastors had no other aim than summoning all
Christian warriors to arms. The voices of preachers were
not the only trumpet-calls; poetry herself, who had but recently
revived in the southern provinces of France, chose
the holy expeditions as the themes of her songs; and the
profane muse of the troubadours mingled their notes with
the animated words of the sacred orators. The Pierres
d’Auvergne, the Ponces de Capdeuil, the Folquets de
Romano, ceased to sing the love of ladies and the courtesy
of knights, to celebrate in their verses, the sufferings of
Christ and the captivity of Jerusalem. “The times are
come,” said they, “in which it will be seen who are the men
worthy of serving the Eternal. God now calls upon the
valiant and chivalrous; they shall be his soldiers for ever,
who, knowing how to suffer for their faith, and fight for God,
shall prove themselves frank, generous, loyal, and brave; let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
the base lovers of life or seekers for gold remain behind.
God now only calls upon the good and brave. It is his will
that his faithful servants should secure salvation by noble
feats of arms; and that glory obtained in fight should open
to them the gates of heaven.”<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>One of the minstrels of the holy war celebrates in his
verses the zeal, the prudence, and courage of the head of the
Church; and to induce the faithful to assume the cross,
sings: “<i>We have a sure and valorous guide, the sovereign
pontiff Innocent</i>.”</p>

<p>It then began to be hoped that the father of the Christians
would himself lead the Crusaders, and sanctify the
Asiatic expedition by his presence. The pope, in the council
of the Lateran, had expressed a desire to assume the
cross, and to go in person to take possession of the heritage
of Christ; but the state of Europe, the progress of heresy,
and, doubtless, also, the advice of the bishops and cardinals,
prevented the accomplishment of his design.</p>

<p>As germs of dissension still subsisted between several
European states, these discords might be prejudicial to the
success of the holy war; and the pope sent forth emissaries
to act as angels of peace; he himself repairing to Tuscany,
to appease the quarrels that had broken out between the
Pisans and Genoese. His words soothed down all angry
passions; at his voice the most implacable enemies swore to
forget their disputes, and unite to combat against the Saracens.
His most ardent wishes appeared about to be fulfilled,
and the whole West, obedient to his sovereign will, was
ready to precipitate itself upon Asia, when he fell suddenly
ill, and died, leaving to his successors the care and honour
of finishing so great an enterprise.</p>

<p>Like all men who have exercised great power amidst political
tempests, Innocent, after his death, was, by turns,
praised and blamed with all the exaggeration of love and
hatred. Some said he had been summoned to the heavenly
Jerusalem, as God wished to reward his zeal for the deliverance
of the holy places; whilst others had recourse to miraculous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
apparitions, and made saints speak in condemnation
of his memory; sometimes he was seen pursued by a dragon,
whose purpose was to inflict justice upon him; and at
others he appeared surrounded by the flames of purgatory.
Europe had been in a constant state of trouble during his
pontificate; there was scarcely a kingdom upon which the
wrath of the pontiff had not been poured out; and so many
excesses, so many misfortunes had embittered men’s minds,
that it was natural they should take a pleasure in believing
that the vicar of Christ upon earth was expiating in another
life the crimes of this. Innocent, nevertheless was irreproachable
in his manners; at first he had evinced some
degree of moderation; he loved truth and justice; but the
unhappy condition of the Church, the obstacles of all kinds
which he met with in his spiritual<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> government, irritated
his character, and drove him to the excesses of a violent
policy; at length, preserving no propriety or self-command,
he burst forth with the ever-memorable and reprehensible
words: “<i>Sword, sword, spring from the scabbard, and sharpen
thyself to kill</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> As he had undertaken far too much, he
left serious embarrassments to those who might assume the
reins of power after him; and such was the situation in
which his policy had placed the Holy See, that his successors
were obliged to follow up his maxims, and complete both
the good and the evil he had begun. From this period, the
history of the crusades will be incessantly interrupted by
the quarrels of popes and princes, and we shall follow the
pilgrims to the Holy Land amidst the clashing of the thunders
launched by the various heads of the Church.</p>

<p>Censius Savelli, cardinal of St. Lucia, was chosen by the
conclave to succeed Innocent, and governed the Church
under the name of Honorius III. On the day after his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
coronation, the new pope wrote to the king of Jerusalem, to
announce his elevation, and to revive the hopes of the Christians
of Syria. “Let not the death of Innocent,” said he,
“depress your courage; although I am far from being his
equal in merit, I will show the same zeal for the deliverance
of the Holy Land; and when the season shall arrive, will do
everything in my power to assist you.” A pontifical letter,
addressed to all bishops, exhorted them to continue to
preach the crusade.</p>

<p>In order to secure success to the Oriental expedition,
Innocent had first endeavoured to re-establish peace in
Europe; and certainly the necessity in which the popes
found themselves at such times, to promote concord among
nations, was one of the greatest benefits of the holy wars.
Honorius followed the example of his predecessor, and was
desirous of calming all discords, even such as owed their
origin to the pretensions of the Romish see. Louis VIII.,
son of Philip Augustus, at the solicitation of the pontiff, had
taken arms against England, and was not willing to renounce
the project of invading a kingdom so long subjected to the
anger of the Church. The pope even stooped to supplications
to disarm the redoubtable enemy of the king of
England. He hoped that England and France, after having
suspended their hostilities, would unite their efforts for the
deliverance of the holy places; but these hopes were never
accomplished. Henry III. ascended the throne of England
after the death of John, and took the cross to secure the
favour of the sovereign pontiff; but he had no idea of
quitting his kingdom. The king of France, constantly
occupied with the war against the Albigeois, and perhaps
also with the secret designs of his ambition, satisfied himself
with expressing the greatest respect for the authority of the
Holy See, but took no part in the crusade.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>Most of the bishops and prelates of the kingdom, whom
the sovereign pontiff had entreated to present an example of
devotedness, exhibited much greater eagerness and zeal on
this occasion than the barons and knights; many of them
took the cross, and prepared to set out for the East. Frederick,
who owed the imperial crown to the protection of the
Church, renewed, in two solemn assemblies, his oath to make
war against the Saracens. The example and promises of
the emperor, whatever doubt might be entertained of their
sincerity, had a powerful effect over the princes and people
of Germany. The inhabitants of the banks of the Rhine,
those of Friesland, Bavaria, Saxony, and Norway; the dukes
of Austria, Moravia, Brabant, and Lemburg; the counts of
Juliers, Holland, De Wit, and Loo; with the archbishop of
Mayence and the bishops of Bamberg, Passau, Strasburg,
Munster, and Utrecht, emulatively ranged themselves under
the banners of the cross, and prepared to quit the West.</p>

<p>Among the princes who took the oath to fight against the
Mussulmans, was Andrew II., king of Hungary. Bela, the
father of the Hungarian monarch, had made a vow to go to
the Holy Land; but not having been able to undertake the
pilgrimage, he had, on his death-bed, required his son to
accomplish his oath. Andrew, after having taken the cross,
was for a long time detained in his states by the troubles to
which his ambition had given birth, and which he had great
difficulty in suppressing. Gertrude, whom he had married
before the fifth crusade, made enemies of the whole court
and nobility by her pride and her intrigues. This imperious
princess<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> committed such extraordinary insults against the
magnates of the kingdom, and inspired them with so violent
a hatred, that they formed conspiracies against her life, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
introduced murderers even into her palace. Disorders and
misfortunes without number followed these crimes, the
greatest of which, doubtless, was the impunity of the guilty.</p>

<p>In such circumstances policy would certainly have pointed
it out to the king of Hungary, as his duty, to remain in his
own states; but the spectacle of so many unpunished crimes,
without doubt, alarmed his weakness, and strengthened his
desire of getting at a distance from a court filled with his
enemies. Like his mother, the widow of Bela,<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> he expected
to find in the places consecrated by the sufferings of Christ,
an asylum against the griefs which beset his life; the Hungarian
monarch might likewise think that the holy pilgrimage
would make him more respected by his subjects, and that
the Church, ever armed in favour of royal crusaders, would
defend the rights of his crown better than he himself could.
He resolved at length to perform the vow he had made
before his dying father, and earnestly set about preparations
for his departure for Syria.</p>

<p>Andrew then reigned over a vast kingdom,&mdash;Hungary,
Dalmatia, Croatia, Bosnia, Galicia, and the province of
Lodomira obeyed his laws, and paid him tribute; and
throughout all these provinces, so lately enemies to the
Christians, the crusades were preached. Hordes wandering
amidst forests, listened to the complaints of Sion, and swore
to fight against the infidels. Among the nations of Hungary,
who, a century before, had been the terror of the pilgrim
companions of Peter the Hermit, a crowd of warriors
eagerly took the cross, and promised to follow their monarch
to the Holy Land.</p>

<p>Vessels and fleets for the transport of the Crusaders were
equipped in all the ports of the Baltic, the ocean, and the
Mediterranean; and yet, at the very same time, a crusade
was being preached against the inhabitants of Prussia, who
still remained in the darkness of idolatry. Poland, Saxony,
Norway, and Livonia armed their warriors to overthrow the
idols of paganism on the banks of the Oder and the Vistula,
whilst the other nations of the West were preparing to make
war against the Saracens in the plains of Judæa and Syria.</p>

<p>The still savage people of Prussia, separated by their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
religion and their customs from the other inhabitants of
Europe, presented in the centre of Christendom, in the
thirteenth century, a living picture of ancient paganism, and
of the superstitions of the old nations of the North. Their
character and their manners are worthy of fixing the attention
of both the historian and his readers, fatigued, perhaps,
by the constant repetition of the preaching of holy wars,
and the distant expeditions of the Crusaders.</p>

<p>Much discussion has taken place concerning the origin of
the ancient inhabitants of Prussia, and we have nothing on
this head but conjectures and systems. The Prussians were,
in person, like the Germans;<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> blue eyes, a spirited and
lively look, ruddy cheeks, a lofty stature, a robust form, and
light hair: this resemblance to the Germans was produced
by climate, and not by the mixture of the nations; the inhabitants
of Prussia had more affinity with the Lithuanians,
whose language they spoke, and whom they imitated in their
dress. They lived by the chase, fishing, and the flesh of
their flocks; agriculture was not unknown to them; their
mares furnished them with milk, their sheep with wool, their
bees with honey; in commercial transactions they had very
little to do with money: to prepare flax and leather, to split
stones, to sharpen their arms, and to fashion yellow amber,
constituted the whole of their industry. They marked time
by knots tied in thongs, and the hours by the words <i>twilight</i>,
<i>light</i>, <i>dawn</i>, <i>sunrise</i>, <i>evening</i>, <i>the first sleep</i>, &amp;c. The
appearance of the Pleïades directed them in their labours.</p>

<p>The months of the year bore the names of the productions
of the earth, and of the objects presented to their eyes by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
each season; they knew the month of crows, the month of
pigeons, that of cuckoos, of the green birch-trees, of the
linden-trees, of corn, of the departure of the birds, of the
fall of leaves, &amp;c. Wars, the conflagrations of great forests,
hurricanes, and inundations, formed the principal epochs of
their history.</p>

<p>The people dwelt in huts built of earth, the rich in houses
constructed of oak timber; there was not a city in Prussia.
Some strong castles appeared upon the hills. This nation,
though savage, recognised princes and nobles; he who had
conquered enemies, and he who excelled in taming horses,
attained nobility. The lords held the right of life and death
over their vassals; the Prussians made no wars for the purpose
of conquering an enemy’s country, but solely to defend
their homes and their gods. Their arms consisted of the
lance and the javelin, which they handled with much skill.
The warriors named their chief, who was blessed by the high
priest; before going to battle, the Prussians selected one of
their prisoners of war, fastened him to a tree, and transfixed
him with arrows.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> They believed in omens; the eagle, the
white pigeon, the crow, the stork, the bustard, promised
victory; the stag, the wolf, the lynx, the mouse, the sight of
a sick person, or even of an old woman, announced defeats
or reverses; when presenting their hand, they offered peace;
when swearing to treaties, they placed one hand upon their
breast and the other upon the sacred oak. When victorious,
they tried their prisoners of war, and the most distinguished
among them expired at the stake,&mdash;a sacrifice to the gods of
the country.</p>

<p>Amidst all their barbarous customs, the Prussians had
the reputation of respecting the laws of hospitality. The
stranger and the shipwrecked mariner were sure to find an
asylum and succour among them; intrepid in war, simple
and mild in peace, grateful but vindictive, respecting misfortune,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
they had more virtues than vices, and were only
corrupted by the excess of their superstition.</p>

<p>The Prussians believed in another life; they called hell,
<i>Peckla</i>; chains, thick darkness, and fetid waters constituted
the punishment of the wicked. In the Elysian fields, which
they called <i>Rogus</i>, beautiful women, banquets, delicious
drink, dances, soft couches, and fine clothes were the rewards
of virtue.</p>

<p>In a place called <i>Remové</i>, arose a flourishing oak, which
had witnessed the passage of a hundred generations, whose
colossal trunk contained three images of their principal gods;
the foliage daily dripped with the blood of immolated victims;
there the high priest had established his abode, and there
administered justice. The priests alone ventured to approach
this holy place; the guilty slunk from it trembling. <i>Perkunas</i>,
the god of thunder and fire, was the first among the
deities of the Prussians; he had the countenance of an
angry man, his beard was curled, and his head was surrounded
with flames. The people called claps of thunder, the march
or steps of Perkunas. Near the grove of Remové, on the
banks of a sulphureous spring, an eternal fire burned in
honour of the god of thunder.</p>

<p>Near Perkunas, <i>Potrimpus</i> appeared, in the form of a
young man, wearing a crown of wheat-ears; he was adored
as the god of waters and rivers; he preserved mankind
from the scourge of war, and presided over the pleasures of
peace. By a strange contradiction, they offered up to this
pacific divinity, the blood of animals, and that of the captives
slaughtered at the foot of the oak; sometimes children were
sacrificed to him; the priests consecrated the serpent to him,
as symbolical of fortune.</p>

<p>Beneath the shade of the sacred tree, was still another
idol, called <i>Pycollos</i>, the god of the dead; he bore the form
of an old man, with grey hair, hollow eyes, and a pale countenance,
his head enfolded in a shroud; his altars were heaps
of human bones; the infernal deities were obedient to his
laws; he inspired both grief and terror.</p>

<p>A fourth divinity, <i>Curko</i>, whose image ornamented the
branches of the oak of Remové, furnished mankind with the
necessaries of life. Every year, at autumnal seed-time, his
image was renewed; it consisted of a goat-skin, elevated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
upon a pole eight feet high, crowned with blades of corn;
the priest sacrificed upon a stone, honey, milk, and the fruits
of the earth, whilst the youth of both sexes formed a circle
round the idol.</p>

<p>The Prussians celebrated several other festivals during
spring and summer, in honour of the same god; at the
spring festival, which took place on the 22nd of March,
they addressed Curko in these words: “It is thou who hast
chased away winter, and brought fair and fine days back to
us; by thee the gardens and the fields rebloom; by thee
the forests and the woods resume their verdure.” The inhabitants
of Prussia had a crowd of other gods, whom they
invoked for their flocks, their bees, the forests, the waters,
harvest, commerce, the peace of families, and conjugal happiness;
a divinity with a hundred eyes watched over the
threshold of houses; one god guarded the yard, another the
stable; the hunter heard the spirit of the forest howl amidst
the tree-tops; the mariner recommended himself to the god
of the sea. <i>Laimelé</i> was invoked by women in labour, and
spun the lives of mankind. Tutelary divinities arrested the
progress of conflagrations, caused the sap of the birch-trees
to flow, guarded roads, and awakened workmen and labourers
before the dawn of day. The air, the earth, the waters were
peopled by gnomes or little gods, and with ghosts and
goblins, which they called <i>arvans</i>. It was believed by all
that the oak was a tree dear to the gods, and that its shade
offered an asylum against the violence of men or the assaults
of destiny. In addition to the oak of Remové, the Prussians
had several other trees of the same kind, which they considered
the sanctuaries of their divinities. They consecrated
also linden-trees, firs, maples, and even whole forests; they
held in reverence fountains, lakes, and mountains; they
adored serpents, owls, storks, and other animals: in short,
in the countries inhabited by the Prussians, all nature was
filled with divinities, and, up to the fourteenth century, it
might be said of a European nation, as Bossuet said of
ancient paganism, “<i>Everything there was god, except God
himself</i>.”</p>

<p>A long time before the crusades, St. Adalbert had left his
native country, Bohemia, to penetrate into the forests of
Prussia, and endeavour to convert the Prussians to Christianity;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
but his eloquence, his moderation, or his charity,
could not disarm the fury of the priests of Perkunas.
Adalbert died, pierced with arrows, and received the palm
of martyrdom; other missionaries shared the same fate;
their blood arose against their murderers, and the report of
their death, together with an account of the cruelties of a
barbarous people, everywhere cried aloud upon the Christians
of the North for vengeance. The neighbouring nations
were constantly entertaining the resolution to take arms
against the idolaters of Prussia. An abbot of the monastery
of Oliva, more able, and still further, more fortunate than
his predecessors, undertook the conversion of the pagans of
the Oder and the Vistula, and succeeded, with the assistance
of the Holy See, in getting up a crusade against the worshippers
of false gods; a great number of Christians took
the cross, at the summons of the pope, who promised them
eternal life if they fell in fight, and lands and treasures if
they triumphed over the enemies of Christ. The knights of
Christ and the knights of the sword, instituted to subdue
the pagans of Livonia, with the Teutonic knights, who in
Palestine rivalled in power and glory the two other orders
of the Temple and the Hospital, at the first signal flocked to
the standards of the army assembled to invade Prussia, and
convert its inhabitants: this war lasted more than two centuries.
In this sanguinary struggle, if the Christian religion
sometimes inspired its combatants with its virtues, the leaders
of this long crusade were much more frequently influenced
by vengeance, ambition, and avarice. The knights of the
Teutonic order, whose bravery almost always amounted to
heroism, remained masters of the country conquered by their
arms. These victorious monks never edified the people they
subdued, either by their moderation or their charity; and
were often accused before the tribunal of the head of the
Church, of having converted the Prussians, not to make them
servants of Christ, but to increase the number of their own
subjects and slaves.</p>

<p>We have only spoken of the people of Prussia, and of the
wars made against them, to exhibit to our readers a nation
and customs almost unknown to modern scholars even; and
to show how far ambition and a thirst of conquest was able
to abuse the spirit of the crusades: we hasten to return to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
the expedition that was being prepared against the
Saracens.</p>

<p>Germany considered Frederick II. as the leader of the
war about to be made in Asia; but the new emperor, seated
on a throne for a long time shaken by civil wars, dreading
the enterprises of the Italian republics, and perhaps those
of the popes their protectors, thought it prudent to defer
his departure for Palestine.</p>

<p>The zeal of the Crusaders, however, did not abate, and in
their impatience they turned their eyes towards the king of
Hungary to take the command in the holy war. Andrew,
accompanied by the duke of Bavaria, the duke of Austria,
and the German nobles who had taken the cross, set out for
the East, at the head of a numerous army, and repaired to
Spalatro, where vessels from Venice, Zara, Ancona, and other
cities of the Adriatic, awaited the Crusaders, to transport
them into Palestine.</p>

<p>In all the countries through which he marched, the king
of Hungary was followed by the benedictions of the people.
When he approached the city of Spalatro, the inhabitants
and the clergy came out in procession to meet him, and conducted
him to their principal church, where all the faithful
were assembled to call down the mercy of Heaven upon the
Christian warriors. A few days after, the fleet of the Crusaders
left the port<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> of Spalatro, and set sail for the island
of Cyprus, at which place were met the deputies of the king
and the patriarch of Jerusalem, of the orders of the Temple
and St. John, and of the Teutonic knights.</p>

<p>A crowd of Crusaders, who had embarked at Brindisi, at
Genoa, and at Marseilles, preceded the king of Hungary and
his army. Lusignan, king of Cyprus, and the greater part
of his barons, influenced by the example of so many illustrious
princes, took the cross, and promised to follow them
into the Holy Land. All the Crusaders embarked together
at the port of Lemisso, and landed in triumph at Ptolemaïs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>An Arabian historian says, that since the time of Saladin
the Christians had never had so numerous an army in Syria.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>
Thanks to Heaven were offered up in all the churches, for
the powerful aid it had sent to the Holy Land; but the joy
of the Christians of Palestine was quickly troubled by the
serious difficulty in which they found themselves to procure
provisions for such a multitude of pilgrims.</p>

<p>This year (1217) had been barren throughout the richest
countries of Syria;<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> and the vessels from the West had
only been laden with machines of war, arms, and baggage.
Deficiency of food was soon felt among the Crusaders, and
led the soldiers to license and robbery; the Bavarians committed
the greatest disorders; pillaging houses and monasteries,
and devastating the neighbouring country; the leaders
had no other means of reëstablishing order and peace in the
army, but by giving the signal for war against the Saracens;
and, to save the lands and dwellings of the Christians, they
proposed to their soldiers to ravage the cities and territories
of the infidels.</p>

<p>The whole army, commanded by the kings of Jerusalem,
Cyprus, and Hungary, encamped on the banks of the torrent
of Cison. The patriarch of the holy city, in order to strike
the imagination of the Crusaders, and prevent their forgetting
the object of their enterprise, repaired to the camp,
bringing with him a portion of the wood of the true cross,
which he pretended to have been saved at the battle of
Tiberias. The kings and princes came out, barefooted, to
meet him, and received with respect the sign of redemption.
This ceremony rekindled the zeal and enthusiasm of the
Crusaders, whose ardent desire now was to fight for Christ.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
The army crossed the torrent, and advanced towards the
valley of Jesraël, between Mount Hermon and Mount
Gelboé, without meeting an enemy. The leaders and soldiers
bathed in the Jordan, and passed over the plain of
Jericho, and along the shores of the great lake of Genesareth.
The Christian army marched singing spiritual songs; religion
and its remembrances had restored discipline and peace
among them. Every object and place they beheld around
them filled them with a pious veneration for the Holy Land.
In this campaign, which was a true pilgrimage, they made a
great number of prisoners without fighting a battle, and returned
to Ptolemaïs loaded with booty.</p>

<p>At the period of this crusade, Malek-Adel no longer
reigned over either Syria or Egypt. After having mounted
the throne of Saladin by injustice and violence, he had descended
from it voluntarily; the conqueror of all obstacles,
and having no longer a wish to form, he became sensible of
the emptiness of human grandeur, and gave up the reins of
an empire that nobody had the power to dispute with him.
Melik Kamel, the eldest of his sons, was sultan of Cairo;
and Corradin<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> was sultan of Damascus. His other sons
had received, as their shares of the empire, the principalities
of Bosra, Baalbec, Mesopotamia, &amp;c. Malek-Adel, relieved
from the cares of government, visited his children by turns,
and preserved peace among them. All he had reserved of
his past power was the ascendancy of a great renown, and
of a glory acquired by numberless heroic exploits; but this
ascendancy held princes, people, and army in subjection. In
moments of peril, his counsels became laws: the soldiers
still considered him as their leader; his sons as their sovereign
arbiter; and all Mussulmans as their defender and
support.</p>

<p>The new crusade had spread terror among the infidels,
but Malek-Adel calmed their fears by assuring them that the
Christians would soon be divided amongst themselves, and
by telling them that this formidable expedition resembled
the storms which howl over Mount Libanus, and which disperse
of themselves: neither the armies of Egypt, nor the
armies of Syria, made their appearance in Judæa; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
Crusaders assembled at Ptolemaïs were astonished at meeting
no enemy to contend with. The leaders of the Christian
army had resolved to direct their march towards the banks
of the Nile; but winter, which was about to commence,
would not permit them to undertake so distant an enterprise.
To employ the soldiers, whom idleness always seduced
into license, it was determined to make an attack upon
Mount Tabor, where the Mussulmans had fortified themselves.</p>

<p>Mount Tabor, so celebrated in the Old and New Testament,
arises like a superb dome amidst the vast plain of
Galilee. The declivity of the mountain is covered with
flowers and odoriferous plants; from the summit of Tabor,
which forms a level of a league in extent, may be seen, travellers
say, all the banks of the Jordan, the Lake of Tiberias,
the Sea of Syria, and most of the places in which Christ
performed his miracles.</p>

<p>A church, the erection of which was due to the piety of
St. Helena, stood on the very spot where the transfiguration
of Christ took place in presence of his disciples, and for a
length of time attracted crowds of pilgrims. Two monasteries,
built at the summit of Tabor, recalled for centuries
the memory of Moses and Elias, whose names they bore; but,
from the reign of Saladin, the standard of Mahomet had
floated over this holy mountain; the church of St. Helena
and the monasteries of Moses and Elias had been demolished,
and upon their ruins was raised a fortress, from which
the Mussulmans constantly threatened the territories of
Ptolemaïs.</p>

<p>It was impossible to ascend Mount Tabor without encountering
a thousand dangers; but nothing intimidated
the Christian warriors: the patriarch of Jerusalem, who
marched at their head, showed them the true cross, and
animated them by his example and his eloquent words.
Enormous stones rolled from the heights occupied by the
infidels, who poured down an endless shower of javelins and
arrows upon all the roads which led to the top of the mountain.
The valour of the soldiers of the cross braved all the
efforts of the Saracens; the king of Jerusalem distinguished
himself by prodigies of bravery, and killed two emirs with
his own hand. The summit of the mountain being attained,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
the Crusaders dispersed the Mussulmans, and pursued them
to the gates of their fortress: nothing could resist their
arms. But all at once several of the leaders began to entertain
suspicions regarding the intentions of the sultan of
Damascus; and the fear of a surprise acted the more
strongly on their minds from no one having foreseen it.
Whilst the Mussulmans retired filled with terror behind
their ramparts, a sudden panic seized the conquerors: the
Crusaders renounced the attack of the fortress, and the
whole Christian army retreated without effecting anything;
as if it had only ascended Mount Tabor to contemplate the
spot rendered sacred by the transfiguration of the Saviour.</p>

<p>We could scarcely yield faith to the account of this precipitate
flight, without the evidence of contemporary historians;<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>
the ancient chronicles, according to their custom,
do not fail to attribute to treachery an event they cannot
comprehend; it appears to us, however, much more natural
to suppose that the retreat of the Crusaders was produced
by the discord and want of foresight which prevailed in all
their undertakings.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>This retreat had most fatal results; whilst the leaders reproached
each other with the disgrace of the army and the
egregious error they had committed, the knights and soldiers
sank into a state of discouragement. The patriarch
of Jerusalem refused from that time to bear the wood of the
true cross in the van of the Crusaders, as he found the sight
of it could neither revive their piety nor reanimate their
courage. The kings and princes who directed the crusade,
wishing to retrieve so shameful a reverse before they returned
to Palestine, led the army towards Phœnicia. In this new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
campaign no exploit signalized their arms being winter, a
great number of the soldiers, overcome by cold, remained
abandoned on the roads, whilst others fell into the hands of
the Bedouin Arabs. On Christmas eve, the Crusaders, who
were encamped between Tyre and Sarphat, were surprised
by a violent tempest; wind, rain, hail, whirlwinds, incessant
peals of thunder killed their horses, carried away their tents,
and scattered their baggage. This disaster completed their
despondency, and created a belief that Heaven refused them
its support.</p>

<p>As they were in serious want of provisions, and the whole
army could not subsist in one place, they resolved to divide
themselves into four different bodies till the end of winter.
This separation, which was made amidst mutual complaints,
appeared to be the work of discord much more than of
necessity. The king of Jerusalem, the duke of Austria, and
the grand master of St. John encamped in the plains of
Cæsarea; the king of Hungary, the king of Cyprus, and
Raymond, son of the prince of Antioch, retired to Tripoli;<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>
the grand masters of the Templars and the Teutonic knights,
and Andrew d’Avesnes, with the Flemish Crusaders, went
to fortify a castle built at the foot of Mount Carmel; the
other Crusaders retired to Ptolemaïs with the intention of
going back to Europe.</p>

<p>The king of Cyprus fell ill and died just as he was upon
the point of embarking for his own kingdom. The king of
Hungary was discouraged, and began to despair of the success
of a war so unfortunately commenced. This prince,
after a sojourn of three months in Palestine, thought his
vow accomplished, and resolved, all at once, to return to his
dominions.</p>

<p>The West had doubtless been surprised to see Andrew
abandon his kingdom, torn by factions, to repair to Syria;
and the Eastern Christians were not less astonished at seeing
this prince leave Palestine without having done anything
for the deliverance of the holy places. The patriarch
of Jerusalem reproached him with inconstancy, and employed
his utmost efforts to retain him beneath the banners of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
cross; but finding Andrew would not yield to his prayers,
he had recourse to threats, and displayed the formidable
train of the weapons of the Church. Nothing, however,
could shake the resolution of the king of Hungary, who
satisfied himself with not appearing to desert the cause of
Christ by leaving half his troops under the command of the
king of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>After having quitted Palestine, Andrew remained for a
long time in Armenia, appearing to forget his own enemies,
as he had forgotten those of Christ. He came back into
Europe through Asia Minor and beheld, whilst passing Constantinople,
the wreck of the Latin empire, which ought to
have roused him from his pious indolence, and have reminded
him of his own dangers. The Hungarian monarch, who had
left his army in Syria, took back with him a number of relics;
such as the head of St. Peter, the right hand of the apostle
Thomas, and one of the seven vases in which Christ changed
water into wine at the marriage in Cana: his confidence in
these revered objects made him negligent of the means of
human prudence; and, if we may believe a contemporary
chronicle,<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> when he returned into Hungary, the relics
which he brought from the Holy Land sufficed for the suppression
of all the troubles of his states, and caused peace,
the laws, and justice, to nourish throughout his provinces.
The greater part of the Hungarian historians, however, hold
quite another language,<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> and reproach their monarch with
having dissipated his treasures and his armies in an imprudent
and an unfortunate expedition; the nobility and people
took advantage of his long absence to impose laws upon
him, and obtain liberties and privileges which weakened the
royal power, and scattered the germs of a rapid decay in the
kingdom of Hungary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>After the departure of the king of Hungary, a great
number of Crusaders arrived from the ports of Holland,
France, and Italy. The Crusaders from Friesland, Cologne,
and the banks of the Rhine had stopped on the coast of
Portugal, where they had conquered the Moors in several great
battles, killed two Saracen princes, and mounted the banners
of the cross upon the walls of Alcazar. They described
the miracles by which Heaven had seconded their valour,
and the apparition of angels, clothed in resplendent armour,
who had fought on the banks of the Tagus, in the ranks of
the soldiers of Christ.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> The arrival of these warriors, with
the account of their victories, revived the courage of the
Crusaders who had remained in Palestine under the command
of Leopold, duke of Austria; with such a powerful
reinforcement, nothing was talked of but renewing the war
against the Mussulmans.</p>

<p>The project of conquering the banks of the Nile often
occupied the thoughts of the Christians; since the idea of a
war in Egypt had been put forth by the pope himself amidst
the council of the Lateran, it had been considered as an inspiration
from Heaven; they only thought of the advantages
of a rich conquest, and the perils of so difficult an enterprise
appeared of no importance in the eyes of the soldiers of the
cross.</p>

<p>The Christian army, commanded by the king of Jerusalem,
the duke of Austria, and William, count of Holland,
embarked at the port of Ptolemaïs, and landed within sight
of Damietta, on the northern bank of the second mouth of
the Nile. The city of Damietta,<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> situated at the distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
of a mile from the sea, had a double rampart on the river
side, and a triple wall on the land side; a tower arose in the
middle of the Nile, and an iron chain, which reached from
the city to the tower, prevented the passage of vessels. The
city contained a numerous garrison, with provisions and
munitions of war for a long siege. Damietta had already
several times resisted formidable attacks of the Christians.
Roger, king of Sicily, had made himself master of it in the
preceding century, but he was not able to retain and defend
it, against the united forces of the Mussulmans.</p>

<p>The Crusaders arrived before Damietta early in April;
having pitched their tents in a vast plain, they had behind
them lakes and pools abounding in fish of all kinds;<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> before
them the Nile, covered with their vessels; a thousand canals,
crowned with evergreen papyrus and reeds, intersected the
lands, and spread freshness and fertility around them. In
the fields which had so lately been the theatre of sanguinary
contests, no traces of war were to be seen; harvests of rice
covered the plains in which Christian armies had perished
by famine; groves of oranges and citrons loaded with flowers
and fruit; woods of palms and sycamores, thickets of jasmines
and odoriferous shrubs, with a crowd of plants and
wonders, unknown to the pilgrims, created the image of an
earthly paradise, and made them fancy that Damietta must
have been the first dwelling of man in his state of innocence.
The aspect of a beautiful sky and a rich climate intoxicated
them with joy, kept hope alive in their hearts, and held out
to them the accomplishment of all the divine promises. In
their religious and warlike enthusiasm, they believed they
saw Providence prodigal of its miracles for the success of
their arms; scarcely had they established their camp on the
bank of the Nile, when an eclipse of the moon covered the
horizon with darkness; and even this phenomenon inflamed
their courage, as it appeared to them a presage of the greatest
victories.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>The first attacks<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> were directed against the tower built in
the middle of the Nile; vessels, in which were placed towers,
ladders, and drawbridges, approached the walls. The soldiers
who manned them, braving the arrows and murderous
machines of the Mussulmans, made several assaults; but
prodigies of strength, courage, and skill were useless. The
most intrepid of the Crusaders, victims of their own rash
bravery and devotedness, perished, swallowed up by the
waves, without being able to be succoured or avenged by
their companions. In all the attacks, nothing could equal
the impetuous valour of the Western warriors; but this
valour was not seconded by either the prudence of the commanders
or the discipline of the soldiers; each nation had
its leader, its machines of war, its days for fighting; no order
governed either attack or retreat; the soldiers on board the
vessels wished to manœuvre them, the sailors would fight.</p>

<p>The frequent checks they experienced, at length, however,
taught them prudence: the lightest of their vessels ascended
the Nile, and returning to cast anchor above the tower built
in the middle of the river, attacked and broke asunder the
bridge of boats which united the tower with the city. Industry
likewise lent its assistance to the bravery of the
Crusaders; machines of war were invented, of which no
models had previously existed. An enormous wooden castle,
built upon two vessels,<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> joined together by beams and joists,
was admired as a miraculous invention, and considered as a
certain pledge of victory. Upon this floating castle was a
drawbridge, which could be lowered upon the tower of the
Saracens, and galleries destined to receive the soldiers who
were to attack the walls. A poor priest of the church of
Cologne,<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> who had preached the crusade on the banks of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
Rhine, and followed the Christian army into Egypt, was
charged with the superintendence of the erection of this
formidable edifice. As the popes in their letters always
advised the Crusaders to take with them to the East men
skilled in the mechanical arts,<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> the Christian army was in
no want of workmen to perform the most difficult labours;
the liberality of the leaders and soldiers supplied all the
necessary expenses.</p>

<p>The whole army looked with impatience for the moment
at which the enormous fortress should be brought near to
the tower on the Nile; prayers were offered up in the camp
for the protection of Heaven; the patriarch and the king of
Jerusalem, the clergy and the soldiers, during several days,
submitted to all the austerities of penitence,&mdash;all marched
in procession barefooted to the seashore. The leaders had
fixed upon the festival of the apostle St. Bartholomew as
the day for the assault, and the Crusaders were filled with
hope and ardour. They vied with each other in eagerness to
be of the assaulting party, for which the best soldiers of each
nation were selected, and Leopold, duke of Austria, the
model of Christian knights, obtained the honour of commanding
an expedition with which the first success of the
crusade was connected.</p>

<p>On the appointed day, the two vessels surmounted by the
wooden tower received the signal for moving. They carried
three hundred warriors fully armed; and an innumerable
multitude of Mussulmans assembled on the walls contemplated
the spectacle with surprise mingled with dread. The
two vessels pursued their silent course up the middle of the
river, whilst all the Crusaders, either drawn up in battle-array
on the left bank of the Nile, or dispersed over the
neighbouring hills, saluted with loudest acclamations the
moving fortress which bore the fortunes and the hopes of the
Christian army. On drawing near to the walls the two
vessels cast anchor, and the soldiers prepared for the assault.
Whilst the Christians hurled their javelins and got ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
their lances and swords, the Saracens poured upon them
torrents of Greek fire, and employed every effort to make
the wooden castle on which their enemies fought a prey to
the flames. The one party was encouraged by the shouts
and applauses of the Christian army, the other by the thousand
times repeated acclamations of the inhabitants of Damietta.
Amidst the fight, the machine of the Crusaders all
at once appeared on fire; the drawbridge lowered on to the
walls of the tower wavered and was unsteady; the flagstaff
of the duke of Austria fell into the Nile, and the banner of
the Christians remained in the hands of the Mussulmans.
At this sight the Saracens uttered the most extravagant
cries of joy, whilst groans and sounds of grief were heard
along the shore on which the Crusaders were encamped; the
patriarch of Jerusalem, the clergy, the whole army, fell on
their knees, and raised their supplicating hands towards
heaven.</p>

<p>But soon, as if God had been favourable to their prayers,
the flames were extinguished, the machine was repaired, the
drawbridge was replaced, and the companions of Leopold
renewed the attack with more ardour than ever. From the
top of their fortress they commanded the walls of the tower,
and dealt mighty blows with sabre, spear, battle-axe, and iron
mace. Two soldiers sprang upon the platform upon which
the Saracens defended themselves; they carried terror among
the besieged, who descended tumultuously to the first stage
of the tower; the latter set fire to the floor, and endeavoured
to oppose a rampart of flames between themselves and the
enemies who rushed down in pursuit of them; but these
last efforts of despair and bravery presented but a vain resistance
to the Christian soldiers. The Mussulmans were
attacked in all parts of the tower; and their walls, shaken
by the machines, appeared to be sinking around them, and
about to bury them beneath the ruins: in this hopeless condition
they laid down their arms, and sued to their conquerors
for life.</p>

<p>After this memorable victory, the Christians, masters of
the tower of the Nile, broke the chain which impeded the
passage of vessels, and their fleet was able to approach close
to the ramparts of the city.</p>

<p>About the same time (September, 1217) Malek-Adel, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
had rendered himself so formidable to the Christians, died
in the capital of Egypt. He heard before his death of the
victory which the Christians had gained at Damietta; and
the Crusaders did not fail to say that he had sunk under the
effects of despair, and that he carried with him to the tomb
the power and glory of the Mussulmans.</p>

<p>The Christians, in their histories, have represented Malek-Adel
as an ambitious, cruel, and stern prince; Oriental
writers celebrate his piety and mildness. An Arabian historian
boasts of his love of justice and truth,<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> and paints, by
a single trait, the moderation of the absolute monarchs of
Asia, when he says, “that the brother of Saladin listened
without anger to that which displeased him.”</p>

<p>Historians unite in praising the bravery of the Mussulman
prince, and the ability he displayed in the execution of all
his designs. No prince knew better how to make himself
obeyed, or to give to supreme power that brilliant exterior
which strikes the imagination of nations, and disposes them
to submission. In his court, he always appeared surrounded
with the pomp of the East: his palace was as a sanctuary
which no one durst approach: he rarely appeared in public;
when he did, it was in a manner to inspire fear: as he was
fortunate in all his undertakings, the Mussulmans had no
difficulty in believing that the favourite of fortune was the
favourite of Heaven: the caliph of Bagdad sent ambassadors
to salute him <i>king of kings</i>. Malek-Adel was pleased to be
styled in camps Seïf Eddin<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> (the sword of religion), and
this glorious name, which he had merited by his contests
with the Christians, drew upon him the love and confidence
of the soldiers of Islamism. He astonished the East by his
abdication, as much as he had astonished it by his victories;
the surprise he excited only added to his glory as well as to
his power; and, that his destiny might in everything be extraordinary,
fortune decreed that when he had descended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
from the throne, he should still remain master. His fifteen
sons, of whom several were sovereigns, still trembled before
him; nations prostrated themselves on his passage; up to the
very hour in which he closed his eyes, his presence, his
name only, maintained peace in his family and the provinces,
and order and discipline in the armies.</p>

<p>At his death the face of everything began to change; the
empire of the Ayoubites, which he had sustained by his exploits,
gave tokens of decline; the ambition of the emirs,
for a long time restrained, broke out into conspiracies
against the supreme authority; a spirit of license began to
be apparent in the Mussulman armies, and particularly
among the troops that defended Egypt.</p>

<p>The Crusaders ought to have profited by the death of
Malek-Adel, and the consequences it was sure to produce,
by attacking the discouraged Mussulmans without intermission.
But instead of following up their success, after
they had obtained possession of the Tower of the Nile, they
all at once neglected the labours of the siege, and appeared
to have fallen asleep over their first victories. A great
number of them, persuaded that they had done enough for
the cause of Christ, only thought of embarking to return
into Europe. Every vessel that left the port recalled to the
pilgrims remembrances of home; and the beautiful sky of
Damietta, which had inflamed their imaginations at the commencement
of the siege, was not sufficient to retain them in
a country which they began to consider as a place of exile.</p>

<p>The clergy, however, warmly censured the retreat and desertion
of the Crusaders, and implored Heaven to punish
the base soldiers who thus abandoned the standards of the
cross. Six thousand pilgrims from Brittany, who were returning
to Europe, were shipwrecked on the coast of Italy, and
almost all perished; and the ecclesiastics, with the most
ardent of the Crusaders, did not fail to see, in so great a disaster,
a manifestation of divine anger. When the Crusaders
of Friesland, after having deserted the banners of the Holy
Land, had returned into the West, the ocean all at once
broke through the dykes, and overflowed its customary boundaries;
the richest provinces of Holland were submerged,
and a hundred thousand inhabitants, with whole cities, disappeared
beneath the waters. Many Christians attributed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
this calamity to the culpable retreat of the Frieson and
Dutch Crusaders.</p>

<p>The pope beheld with pain the return of the pilgrim deserters
from the cause of Christ. Honorius neglected nothing
to secure the success of a war he had preached; and he
every day, both by prayers and threats, pressed the departure
of those who, after having taken the cross, delayed the
accomplishment of their vow.</p>

<p>According to the usual custom of navigators, two periods
of the year were fixed upon at which it was best to cross the
sea. The pilgrims almost always embarked in the month of
March and in the month of September, whether to repair to
the East or to return to Europe; which caused them to be
compared to those birds of passage that change their climate
at the approach of a new season, and towards the end of
fine weather.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> At each passage, the Mediterranean was
covered with vessels which transported Crusaders, some returning
to their homes, others going to fight the infidels.
At the very moment the Christians were deploring the loss
of the Frieson and Dutch warriors, their spirits were restored
by seeing Crusaders from Germany, Pisa, Genoa, Venice, and
several provinces of France, arrive in the camp at Damietta.</p>

<p>Among the French warriors, history names Hervé, count
of Nevers; Hugh, count de la Marche; Miles de Bar-sur-Seine;
the lords John of Artois and Ponce de Crancey;
Ithier de Thacy, and Savary de Mauléon; they were accompanied
by the archbishop of Bordeaux, the bishops of
Angers, Autun, Beauvais, Paris, Meaux, Noyon, &amp;c. England
also sent the bravest of her knights into Egypt. Henry
III. had taken the cross after the council of the Lateran;
but as he could not quit his dominions, at that time a prey
to civil wars and torn by discord, the earls of Harcourt,
Chester, and Arundel, with Prince Oliver,<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> were honoured
with the charge of acquitting, in his name, the vow he had
taken to fight in the East for the cause of Christ.</p>

<p>At the head of the pilgrims who arrived at that time in
Egypt were two cardinals, whom the pope had sent to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
Christian army. Robert de Courçon, one of the preachers
of the crusade, was charged with the mission of inculcating
the moral precepts of Christ in the camp of the Crusaders,
and animating the zeal and devotion of the soldiers by his
eloquence. Cardinal Pelagius, bishop of Albano, was invested
with the entire confidence of the Holy See; he
brought with him the treasures that were to defray the expenses
of the war; the Crusaders from Rome and several
other cities of Italy marched under his orders, and recognised
him as their military leader.</p>

<p>Cardinal Pelagius, by his position, was endowed with
great authority in the Christian army, and his naturally
imperious character led him to assume even more power than
he had received from the Holy See. In whatever affair he
was employed, he acknowledged no equal, and would not endure
a superior. He had been known to oppose the sovereign
pontiff in the bosom of the conclave; he would have
resisted the most powerful monarchs, even in their own
councils. Cardinal Pelagius, persuaded that Providence
meant to make use of him to accomplish great designs, believed
himself fit for all works, and appointed to all kinds of
glory; when he had formed a determination, he maintained
it with invincible obstinacy, and was influenced by neither
obstacles nor perils, nor even by the lessons of experience.
If Pelagius originated any advice in council, he supported it
with all the menaces of the court of Rome, and often gave
cause for a belief that the thunders of the Church had only
been confided to his hands, that he might secure the triumph
of his own opinions.</p>

<p>Pelagius had scarcely arrived in Egypt, when, as legate of
the pope, he disputed the command of the army with John
of Brienne. To support his pretensions, he asserted that
the Crusaders had taken up arms at the desire of the sovereign
pontiff; that they were the soldiers of the Church,
and ought to recognise no other head than the legate of the
Holy See: these assumptions gave great offence to the
barons and principal leaders. From that time it was easy to
foresee that discord would be introduced by him whose
mission it was to establish peace; and that the envoy of the
pope, charged to preach humility among Christians, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
about to ruin everything by his mad presumption.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> Cardinal
de Courçon died shortly after his arrival.</p>

<p>The continuator of William of Tyre, whilst deploring the
death of this legate, who had been remarkable for his moderation,
characterizes, by a single word, the conduct of
Pelagius, and the consequences that might be expected from
it, by saying: “Then died Cardinal Peter, and Pelagius lived,
which was a great pity.”</p>

<p>In the mean time, the approach of danger had reunited
the Mussulman princes. The caliph of Bagdad, whom James
of Vitri<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> styles <i>the pope of the infidels</i>, exhorted the nations
to take up arms against the Christians. All the sons of
Malek-Adel, who reigned over the provinces of Syria and of
Yemen, prepared to march to the assistance of Egypt. The
sultan of Damascus, after having made several incursions
into the territories of Ptolemaïs, gathered together his whole
army, and resolved to go and defend Damietta. As he had
reason to fear the Christians might take advantage of his
absence to seize Jerusalem and fortify themselves in it, he
caused the ramparts of the holy city to be demolished. He
also ordered the fortress of Tabor, and all those that the
Mussulmans held along the coasts of Palestine, to be destroyed;
a vigorous measure that afflicted the infidels, but
was calculated to afflict the Christians still more; as it proved
to them that they had to contend with enemies animated by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
despair, and disposed to sacrifice everything to secure their
own safety.</p>

<p>The sultan of Cairo encamped in the vicinity of Damietta,
where he awaited the princes of his family. The garrison
of the city received every day provisions and reinforcements,
and was in a condition to resist the Christian army for a
length of time. The preparations and the approach of the
Mussulmans at length roused the Crusaders from their state
of inaction. Animated by their leaders, but more by the
appearance of danger and the presence of a formidable
enemy; still led by the king of Jerusalem, who had resisted
the pretensions of Pelagius, the Christian soldiers resumed
the labours of the siege and made several assaults upon the
city on the river side. The winter, which had just set in,
did not at all prevent their attacks; nothing could equal the
heroic constancy with which they braved, during several
months, cold, rain, hunger, all the fatigues of war, and all
the rigours of the season. A contagious malady committed
great ravages in the Christian army: a frightful storm,
which lasted three days, carried away the tents and the
baggage of both leaders and soldiers; but nothing diminished
the fury of the contests, which were incessantly
renewed.</p>

<p>At length the Christians, having become masters of all
the western bank of the Nile, determined to cross the river,
and attack the city on the land side. The passage was
difficult and dangerous; the sultan of Cairo had fixed his
camp on the opposite shore; the plain on which the Crusaders
wished to pitch their tents was covered with Mussulman
soldiers; an unexpected event removed all obstacles.</p>

<p>We have spoken of the seditious spirit of the emirs, who,
since the death of Malek-Adel, had openly shown their ambitious
designs and sought to introduce divisions into the
Mussulman armies. The most remarkable among these
emirs, was the leader of a troop of Curds, named Emad-eddin,<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>
who had taken a part in all the revolutions of Egypt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
and Syria. Associated with the destinies of the sons of
Ayoub, this emir had witnessed the rise and fall of several
Mussulman dynasties, and held in contempt the powers of
which he knew both the source and the origin. An intrepid
soldier, a faithless subject, always ready to serve his sovereigns
in fight or betray them in a conspiracy, Emad-eddin
could not endure a prince who reigned by the laws of peace,
or recognise a power which was not the fruit of his intrigues
or of a revolution. As fortune had always favoured his
audacity, and as all his treacheries had been well rewarded,
every fresh revolt augmented his credit and his renown; an
enemy to all acknowledged authority, the hope of all who
aspired to empire, he was almost as redoubtable as the Old
Man of the Mountain, whose menaces made the most
powerful monarchs tremble. Emad-eddin resolved to change
the government of Egypt, and conceived the project of dethroning
the sultan of Cairo, and replacing him by another
of the sons of Malek-Adel.</p>

<p>Several emirs were drawn into this conspiracy. On the
day appointed, they were to enter the tent of Melic-Kamel,
and compel him, by violence, to renounce the supreme
authority. The sultan was warned of the plot prepared
against him, and on the eve of the day on which it was to
be carried into effect, he left his camp in the middle of the
night. The next day, at dawn, the conspirators were made
aware that their designs had been discovered; they endeavoured
in vain to draw the soldiers into a revolt; the greatest
confusion prevailed throughout the camp; among the emirs,
some gathered around Emad-eddin, and swore to follow his
fortunes; others, doubtful of the success of his enterprise,
remained silent; many took an oath to defend Melic-Kamel.
Amidst these debates, the Mussulman army, conscious that
they were without a leader, feared they might be surprised
by the Christians. A panic terror all at once seized upon
the soldiers, who abandoned their tents and their baggage,
and rushed in the greatest disorder in the traces of their
fugitive sultan.</p>

<p>This retreat, of which the Christians could not imagine
the cause, and which their historians explain by a miracle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
from heaven,<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> opened to them the passage of the Nile. The
army hastened to cross the river, took possession of the
Mussulman camp, made an immense booty, and drew near
to the walls of Damietta.</p>

<p>The panic, however, which had put the Mussulman troops
to flight, had not at all communicated itself to the garrison
of the city: this intrepid garrison offered the most vigorous
resistance, and gave the army of Melic-Kamel<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> time to recover
from its fright. The sultan of Damascus soon joined
his brother the sultan of Cairo. Emad-eddin and the other
leaders of the conspiracy were arrested and loaded with
chains. Order and discipline were reëstablished among the
Saracens, and the Christian army had to contend with all
the united forces of the infidels, impatient to repair their
check, and recover the advantages they had lost.</p>

<p>The burning days of summer were approaching: the
Nile, increased by the rains of the tropics, began to issue
from its bed. The Christian army was encamped under the
walls of Damietta, having the lake Menzaleh in its rear.
The Saracens came and pitched their tents at a short distance
from the camp of the Christians, who, oppressed by
the consuming heat of the season and the climate, were
subject every day to the spirited attacks of the infidels. In
one of these conflicts, the Mussulmans got possession of a
bridge which the Crusaders had thrown over the Nile; the
banks of the river were covered with dead, and the Christian
army only owed its safety to the heroic bravery of the duke
of Austria, the king of Jerusalem, and the grand masters of
St. John and the Temple. Soon after, another battle was
fought still more bloody than the first. In this fight, as it
is described by James of Vitri, an ocular witness, not a person
among the Christians was idle: the clergy were at prayers
or attending the wounded; whilst the women and children
carried water, wine, food, stones, and javelins, to the
combatants. Whirlwinds of scorching dust arose in the air,
and enveloped the two armies. The cries of the wounded
and the dying, the sound of the trumpets, and the clashing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
of arms resounded from the neighbouring hills and from both
shores of the Nile. Sometimes the Saracens were put to
flight, and whole battalions, says James of Vitri, disappeared
submerged in the Nile, as formerly the armies of Pharaoh
perished in the Red Sea. Sometimes the Christians were
repulsed in their turn, and left a great number of their warriors
on the field of battle: the carnage lasted during the
whole day, without either side being able to claim the victory.
Whilst the two armies were contending with such
fury on the banks, the Genoese and the Pisans, on board
their vessels, made an attack upon the ramparts of the city.
Several of their ships were consumed by the Greek fire, and
the bravest of their soldiers were crushed beneath the beams
and stones hurled from the top of the walls. At the approach
of night the Crusaders returned to their tents, despairing of
ever being able to subdue the Saracens, and reproaching
each other with want of courage in this unfortunate day.</p>

<p>On the morrow fresh disputes arose between the horse
and foot soldiers,<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> each of which bodies accused the other
with having been the cause of the losses the army had experienced.
These debates became so warm that at length
the foot and the horse both demanded, with loud cries, to
be led again to battle, and rushed tumultuously out of the
camp, to give convincing proofs of their bravery; the leaders
could neither restrain nor direct the ardour and impetuosity
of their soldiers, who fought in disorder, and were repulsed
by the Saracens after a horrible carnage.</p>

<p>At this period a holy person, named Francis of Assise,
made his appearance in the Christian army, whose reputation
for piety was spread throughout the Christian world,
and had preceded him into the East. From his earliest
youth, Francis had left the paternal roof to lead a life of
edification. One day, whilst present at mass in a church in
Italy, he was struck with the passage of the Gospel in which
our Saviour says, “Take with you neither gold nor silver,
nor other moneys; neither scrips for the journey, nor sandals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
nor staff.” From that period Francis had held in contempt
all the riches of this world, and had devoted himself to the
poverty of the apostles; he travelled through countries and
cities, exhorting all people to penitence. The disciples who
followed him braved the contempt of the multitude, and
glorified themselves with it before God: when asked whence
they came, they were accustomed to answer, “We are poor
penitents from Assise.”</p>

<p>Francis was led into Egypt by the fame of the crusade,
and by the hope of there effecting some great conversion.
The day preceding the last battle, he had a miraculous presentiment
of the defeat of the Christians, and imparted his
prediction to the leaders of the army, who heard him with
indifference. Dissatisfied with the Crusaders, and devoured
by the zeal of a mission from God, he then conceived the
project of securing the triumph of the faith by his eloquence
and the arms of the Gospel alone. He directed his course
towards the enemy’s camp, put himself in the way of being
taken prisoner by the Saracen soldiers, and was conducted
into the presence of the sultan. Then Francis addressed
Melic-Kamel,<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> and said to him, “It is God who sends me
towards you, to point out to you the road to salvation.”
After these words, the missionary exhorted the sultan<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
embrace the Gospel; he challenged in his presence all the
doctors of the law, and to confound imposture and prove the
truth of the Christian religion, offered to cast himself into
the midst of a burning funeral-pile. The sultan, astonished,
ordered the zealous preacher from his presence, who obtained
neither of the objects of his wishes, for he did not
convert the sultan, nor did he gather the palm of martyrdom.</p>

<p>After this adventure, St. Francis returned to Europe,
where he founded the religious order of the Cordeliers, who
at first, possessing neither churches, monasteries, lands, nor
flocks, spread themselves throughout the West, labouring
for the conversion of penitents. The disciples of St. Francis
sometimes carried the word of God among savage nations;
some went into Africa and Asia, seeking, as their master
had done, errors to confute and evils to endure; they frequently
planted the cross of Christ upon the lands of the
infidels, and in their harmless pilgrimages, constantly repeated
the scriptural words, <i>Peace be with you</i>; they were
only armed with their prayers, and aspired to no glory but
that of dying for the faith.</p>

<p>The Crusaders had been encamped seventeen months
before the walls of Damietta, and not a single day had passed
without a murderous conflict. The Mussulmans, although
they had obtained some advantages, began to lose all hope of
triumphing over an enemy proof against the evils of war
and an unhealthy climate. Report proclaimed the approaching
arrival of the emperor of Germany, who had taken the
cross, and this news, whilst it sustained the courage of the
Christians, made the Mussulmans tremble at the idea of
having to contend with the most powerful of the monarchs
of the West. The sultan of Damascus, in the name of all
the princes of his family, sent ambassadors to the camp of
the Crusaders to ask for peace. He offered to abandon to
the Franks the city and kingdom of Jerusalem, and only to
reserve to themselves the places of Krak and Montréal, for
which they proposed to pay a tribute. As the ramparts and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
towers of the holy city had been recently destroyed, the
Mussulmans engaged to pay two hundred thousand dinars
to re-establish them; they further agreed to give up all
Christians made prisoners since the death of Saladin.</p>

<p>The principal leaders of the Christian army were called
together to deliberate upon the proposals of the Mussulmans.
The king of Jerusalem, the French barons, the English,
Dutch, and Germans, were of opinion that the terms should
be acceded to, and the peace accepted: the king of Jerusalem
would regain his kingdom, and the barons of the West
would see the happy end of a war that had detained them
so long from their homes.</p>

<p>“By accepting the peace they attained the object of the
crusade,&mdash;the deliverance of the holy places. The Christian
warriors had besieged Damietta during seventeen months,
and the siege might be still prolonged. Many Crusaders
daily returned to Europe; whilst crowds of Mussulman warriors
as constantly joined the standards of the sultans of
Cairo and Damascus. If they should take Damietta, they
would be but too happy to exchange it for Jerusalem. The
Mussulmans offered to give, before victory, quite as much as
they could demand after having subdued them. It was not
wise to refuse that which fortune offered to bestow upon
them without conflicts or perils. The effusion of blood
should be avoided, and they ought to reflect, that victories
purchased by the death of the soldiers of the cross, were such
as were most acceptable to the God of the Christians.”</p>

<p>The king of Jerusalem and most of the barons spoke thus,
and endeavoured to bring to their opinion the Italian nobles
and the body of the prelates, whom Cardinal Pelagius led in
an opposite direction. The legate of the pope regarded
himself as the head of this war, and he wished it to continue,
in order to prolong his power and to procure for him additional
renown. “He could see nothing in the proposals of
the enemy but a new artifice to delay the capture of Damietta,
and gain time. The Saracens offered nothing but
desert countries and demolished cities, which would fall again
into their power. Their only object was to disarm the
Christians, and furnish them with a pretext for returning
into the West. Things had gone too far to allow them to
retreat without dishonour. It was disgraceful for Christians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
to renounce the conquest of a city they had besieged seventeen
months, and which could hold out no longer. They
must take possession of it first, and then they should know
what was best to be done&mdash;once masters of Damietta, the
Crusaders might conclude a glorious peace, and reap all the
advantages of victory.”</p>

<p>The motives alleged by Cardinal Pelagius were not unreasonable,
but the spirit of party and faction reigned in the
council of the leaders of the crusade. As it always happens
in similar circumstances, every one formed his opinion not
upon that which he believed to be useful and just, but upon
that which appeared most favourable to the party he had
embraced; some advised that the siege should be prosecuted,
because the king of Jerusalem had offered a contrary opinion;
others wished the proposed capitulation should be accepted,
because this capitulation was rejected by the legate of the
pope. The Christian army exhibited a strange spectacle.
On one side, John of Brienne and the most renowned warriors
were advocates for peace; on the other, the legate and
most of the ecclesiastics demanded with great warmth the
continuation of the war: they deliberated during several
days without a chance of bringing the two parties to an
agreement; and whilst the discussions became more intemperate,
hostilities were renewed: then all the Crusaders
united to prosecute the siege of Damietta.</p>

<p>The sultan of Cairo employed every means to throw succours
into the city, and keep up the courage of the garrison
and the inhabitants. Some Mussulman soldiers, taking
advantage of the darkness of night, attempted to effect an
entrance into the place; a few were able to gain and pass
through the gates, but by far the greater number were surprised
and massacred by the Crusaders, who kept constant
and close watch around the walls.</p>

<p>The news which the sultan, Melic-Kamel, received from
Damietta, became every day more alarming, the Mussulman
army, not daring to succour the besieged, remained inactive,
and confined themselves to the defence of their own intrenchments.
Communication was soon entirely cut off
between the place and the camp of the infidels; some divers
crossed the Nile through the Christian fleet, attained Damietta,
and returned to inform the sultan that pestilence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
famine, and despair reigned throughout the city. The Mussulmans
had recourse to all sorts of stratagems to convey
food to the garrison; sometimes they filled leather sacks
with provisions, which, being abandoned to the stream of
the Nile, floated under the ramparts of the city; at others,
they concealed loaves in the sheets that enveloped dead
bodies, which, being borne on by the waters, were stopped in
their course by the besieged. It was not long before these
stratagems were discovered by the Christians, and then
famine began to make horrible ravages; the soldiers, overcome
by fatigue and weakened by hunger, had not the
strength to fight or guard the towers and ramparts. The
inhabitants, given up to despair, abandoned their houses,
and fled from a city that presented nothing but images of
death: many came to implore the pity of the Crusaders.
The commander of Damietta, whose name history has not
preserved, in vain endeavoured to keep up the courage of
the people and the soldiers. To prevent desertion, he caused
the gates of the city to be walled up; and from that period
neither the sultan of Cairo nor the Crusaders were able to
know what was passing in the besieged place, in which a
dismal silence reigned, and which, according to the expression
of an Arabian author, <i>was no longer anything but a
closed sepulchre</i>.</p>

<p>The Christians had placed their machines at the foot of a
tower, and as they saw no one defending it, the legate, at
the head of the Italian Crusaders, took advantage of a dark
and stormy night to penetrate within the first inclosure of
the walls. The king of Jerusalem and the other leaders
resolved at the same time to make an assault and enter the
city, sword in hand. As soon as day appeared, the boldest
ascended into the tower, which they found deserted, and
called aloud upon their companions to join them. The
Christian army applauded their success, and answered by
shouts of joy; the soldiers flew to arms, and instantly put
the rams in motion. The walls were scaled, the gates were
beaten to pieces, and a passage opened; the eager Crusaders
rushed forward with naked swords and ready lances to encounter
the enemy; but when they penetrated into the
streets, a pestilential odour enveloped them, and a frightful
spectacle made them recoil with horror! The public places,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
the mosques, the houses, the whole city, were strewed with
dead!<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> Old age, infancy, ripened manhood, maiden beauty,
matronly grace&mdash;all had perished in the horrors of the siege!
At the arrival of the Crusaders, Damietta contained seventy
thousand inhabitants; of these only three thousand of the
most robust remained, who, ready to expire, glided like pale,
fading shadows among tombs and ruins.</p>

<p>This horrible spectacle touched the hearts of the Crusaders,
and mingled a feeling of sadness with the joy their
victory created. The conquerors found in Damietta immense
stores of spices, diamonds, and precious stuffs. When they
had pillaged the city, it might have been believed, says an
historian, that the warriors of the West had conquered
Persia, Arabia, and the Indies. The ecclesiastics launched
the thunders of excommunication against all who secreted
any part of the booty; but these menaces had no effect upon
the cupidity of the soldiers: all the wealth brought to the
public stock only produced two hundred thousand crowns,
which were distributed among the troops of the victorious
army.</p>

<p>Damietta boasted a celebrated mosque, ornamented by six
vast galleries and a hundred and fifty columns of marble,
surmounted by a superb dome, which towered above all the
other edifices of the city. This mosque, in which, on the
preceding evening, Mussulmans had lifted their imploring,
tearful eyes to their prophet, was consecrated to the virgin
mother of Christ, and the whole Christian army came thither
to offer up thanks to Heaven for the triumph granted to
arms. On the following day the barons and prelates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
assembled in the same place, to deliberate upon their conquest;
and, by a unanimous resolution, the city of Damietta
was assigned to the king of Jerusalem. They then turned
their attention to the fate of the unfortunate inhabitants
who had escaped pestilence and famine. James of Vitri,
when describing the miseries of Damietta, and speaking of
the horrible famine which swept away so many families
during the siege, sheds tears over the little children who in
vain asked their dead parents for bread.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> The fate of such of
those as remained alive inspired the virtuous bishop of
Ptolemaïs with pity, and he purchased many of them, in
order to have them baptized and brought up in the Christian
religion. The pious charity of the prelate, however, could
only procure them eternal life, for they almost all died after
having been baptised. All the Mussulmans who had sufficient
strength to work received liberty and bread, and were
employed in cleansing and purifying the city. Whilst the
leaders were thus watching over a mourning city, and gave
their anxious attentions to prevent new calamities, the spectacle
that Damietta presented, and the empoisoned air they
breathed within its walls, obliged the Christian army to
return to their camp, and wait for the time at which the
conquered city might be inhabited without danger.</p>

<p>When the news of the taking of Damietta was spread
through Syria and Upper Egypt, the Mussulman nations,
seized with terror, flew to their mosques to implore the
intervention of their prophet against the enemies of Islamism.
The sultans of Cairo and Damascus sent ambassadors
to the caliph of Bagdad, conjuring him to exhort all true
believers to take arms to defend the religion of Mahomet.
The caliph contemplated with grief the calamities about to
fall upon the princes of the family of Saladin; but other
dangers threatened him more nearly. Tartar hordes had
issued from their mountains, invaded several provinces of
Persia, and were advancing towards the Euphrates. The
caliph, far from being able to assist the Mussulmans of Syria<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
and Egypt by his prayers and exhortations, invoked their
succour to defend his capital, and turn aside the storm ready
to burst over the whole East. When the Mussulman ambassadors
returned to Damascus and Cairo, their accounts
added new alarms to those which the conquests of the
Christians had already inspired.</p>

<p>The Ayoubite princes, however, did not delay endeavouring
to unite all their efforts against the Crusaders, postponing, to
a more favourable moment, the defence of the head of
Islamism. The Mussulman nations had a much greater
dread of the invasion of the Christians than of the irruptions
of the hordes of Tartary. The conquerors whom
nations fear the most, are those that desire to change the
laws and religion of the conquered country. The Tartars,
whose habits and manners were not formed, easily complied
with those of the people they subdued; the Christians, on
the contrary, only made war to destroy all and enslave all.
Already rich cities, great provinces, were in their power:
everything had changed its form under their domination.
Thus the Mussulman princes and people, from the Euphrates
to the Red Sea, forgot or neglected the storm which growled
over Persia and was advancing slowly towards Syria, and resolved
to take arms against the Crusaders, who were masters
of the Nile.</p>

<p>After the taking of Damietta, the Mussulman soldiers
who defended Egypt were struck with such excessive fear,
that, during several days, not one of them durst face a Christian
soldier. The Egyptian warriors who guarded the fortress
of Tannis, built beyond the lake Menzaleh, abandoned
their ramparts at the approach of a few Crusaders, and thus
one of the firmest bulwarks of the Mussulman empire fell
without defence into the hands of the Franks. From that
time, the Christians had reason to believe they had no more
enemies on the banks of the Nile; and, during the rigours
of winter, many of the pilgrims returned to Europe. Half
the army took advantage of the March passage to quit
Egypt; such as remained under the banners of the crusade
forgot the labours and perils of war, and gave themselves up
to indulgence and voluptuousness, to all the pleasure which
the approach of spring, and the fine climate and beautiful
sky of Damietta inspired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>During the leisure of peace, the divisions which had so
often interrupted the course of the war, soon revived; the
taking of Damietta had inflamed the pride of Cardinal
Pelagius, who, in the Christian army, spoke as a conqueror
and commanded as a master. The king of Jerusalem was so
dissatisfied, that he abandoned a city that had been given to
him, and quitted an army of which he was the head, to
retire to Ptolemaïs.</p>

<p>New Crusaders, however, eager to signalize their valour
against the Mussulmans, arrived daily. The duke of Bavaria,
with four hundred German knights and barons, sent by
Frederick II., landed on the banks of the Nile. A short
time afterwards, the Christian army received into its ranks
Crusaders from Milan, Pisa, and Genoa, and prelates and
archbishops conducted a crowd of defenders of the cross,
who came from the various provinces of Germany, and from
France and Italy. The sovereign pontiff had neglected
nothing to secure the success of the holy war; he sent
to Cardinal Pelagius provisions for the army, and a considerable
sum of money, partly from his own treasury, and
partly from the charity of the faithful of the West.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> The
legate was desirous of profiting by the succours he had just
received, and proposed to follow up the war, and march
directly against the capital of Egypt. The clergy adopted
the advice of Pelagius, but such of the Crusaders as saw
with disgust a prelate at the head of warriors, refused to
take up arms. The duke of Bavaria and the barons and
knights would acknowledge no leader but the king of Jerusalem;
the legate Pelagius was obliged to send deputies to
John of Brienne, who, pressed by the pope himself, was at
length prevailed upon, and consented, after an absence of
several months, to come back and take the command of the
army.</p>

<p>Whilst the Crusaders remained thus in inaction, all the
Mussulmans were flying to arms: the sultans of Damascus
and Aleppo, the princes of Hamah, Balbec, and of Arabia,
assembled fresh armies. After the taking of Damietta, the
sultan of Cairo had retired, with his troops, to the spot where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
the two eastern branches of the Nile separate: there he daily
beheld troops of Mussulman warriors join his standard, and,
awaiting a favourable opportunity, he constructed a palace in
the centre of his camp, surrounded by walls.</p>

<p>The Mussulmans there built houses, baths, and bazaars,
and the camp of the sultan became a city, called Mansourah,
which was destined to be celebrated in history by the defeat
and ruin of the Christian armies.</p>

<p>As soon as the king of Jerusalem returned to Damietta,
the leaders of the Crusaders assembled in council, to deliberate
upon what they had to do: the legate of the pope
was the first to offer his opinion, and proposed to march
against the capital of Egypt. “We must attack the evil at
its source, and, in order to conquer the Saracens, destroy the
foundation of their power. Egypt supplies them with soldiers,
provisions, and arms. By taking possession of Egypt,
we should cut off all their resources. At no period were the
soldiers of the cross animated by more zeal; never were the
infidels more depressed. To lose such an opportunity was
to betray the common cause. When a great empire was
attacked, prudence commanded the assailants not to lay down
their arms till they had subdued it; by stopping after the
first victory, they exhibited more weakness than moderation.
The eyes of the whole Christian world were upon the
army of the Crusaders; it was not only the deliverance of
the holy places that was looked for from their valour, but the
death of all the enemies of Christ, the destruction of every
nation that had imposed a sacrilegious yoke upon the city of
God.”</p>

<p>The bishops, the prelates, and most of the ecclesiastics
were loud in their applause of the speech of the legate; but
John of Brienne, who did not at all partake of their opinion,
arose, and protesting his devotion to the cause of Christ,
began by appealing to the assembly, if any one could be more
interested in the conquests of the Christians in the East,
than the man who had the honour to be king of Jerusalem.
He then pointed out how imprudent it would be to go up
the Nile at the very moment at which that river was beginning
to overflow, and would most likely inundate the roads
which led to Cairo. “Mark,” said he, “all the perils of the
expedition proposed to you. We are to march into an unknown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
land, through the midst of an enemy’s country: if
conquered, there can be no place of asylum for us; if conquerors,
our victories will only weaken our army. However
easy it may be for us to conquer provinces, it will be almost
impossible for us to defend them. The Crusaders, always
eager to return to Europe, are incalculably more serviceable
in gaining battles than in securing the possession of conquered
countries. Nobody can suppose, that with the brave
bands that surround us, we entertain any fear of the Mussulman
armies which are gathering together from all parts; but
in order to secure our safety, we must not only subdue our
enemies, we must destroy them&mdash;we have not to deal with
an army, but with an entire nation animated by despair.
The whole Mussulman race are about to become so many
intrepid soldiers, impatient to shed their blood in the field of
battle. But what do I say? we shall have much less to dread
from their courage than from their timid prudence. They
will not fail to shun the fight, and will wait until diseases,
want, fatigue, discord, the inconstancy of men’s minds, the
overflowing of the Nile, and the heat of the climate shall
have triumphed over our efforts and secured the failure of
all our enterprises.”</p>

<p>John of Brienne strengthened his opinion by other motives,
with which his knowledge of the art of war supplied
him, and terminated his speech by saying, “That Damietta
and Tannis were powerful enough to restrain the people of
Egypt; that it was necessary to recapture the cities they
had lost, before they thought of conquering countries that
had never been in their possession; and that, in short, they
had not assembled under the banners of the cross to besiege
Thebes, Babylon, or Memphis, but to deliver Jerusalem,
which opened its gates to the Christians, and which they
could fortify against all the attacks of the infidels.”</p>

<p>This moderate and pacific language would well have become
the mouth of an envoy of the pope; but Pelagius
listened to the king of Jerusalem with the most evident impatience:
he answered, that weakness and timidity screened
themselves behind the veil of moderation and prudence;
that Christ did not summon to his defence such wise and
far-sighted soldiers, but warriors who sought for battle
rather than for reasons, and who could see the glory of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
enterprise, and be blind to its dangers. The legate added
several more reasons to those he had already advanced, and
expressed them with great bitterness; at length, led away
by the heat of the discussion, he threatened all those who
did not partake of his opinions with excommunication.
Most of the leaders, and the king of Jerusalem himself,
fearing to be excommunicated, but dreading much more to
see the least suspicion cast upon their bravery, at length
yielded to the obstinate will of Pelagius: the council of the
barons and the bishops decided that the Christian army
should leave Damietta, and march against the capital of
Egypt.</p>

<p>This army, composed of more than seventy thousand men,
advanced up the banks of the Nile. A numerous fleet, laden
with provisions, arms, and machines of war, ascended the
river at the same time. The Christian army passed through
Farescour and several other villages, that had been abandoned
by their inhabitants; all fled away at the approach of the
Crusaders, who began to believe they should meet with no
obstacle to their victories, and celebrated, beforehand, the
conquest of Memphis and Cairo. The legate of the pope
exulted in the resolution he had dictated to the Christian
army; and, full of confidence in a prediction that had been
made concerning him in his youth, the presumptuous cardinal
flattered himself that he was about to overthrow the worship
of Mahomet; and indulged in the most insulting railleries
against those who had been opposed to the war. Without
fighting a single battle, the Christians gained the extremity
of the Delta, at the angle formed by the arm of the river
which descends towards Damietta and the canal of Almon,
whose waters flow into the sea on the eastern side. The
Saracens were encamped in the plain of Mansourah, on the
opposite bank of the river: the Crusaders halted on the
hither shore, and their fleet cast anchor as near to them as
possible.</p>

<p>The sultan of Damascus, and the princes of Aleppo,
Balbec, Hamah, and Bosra, had united their troops with
those of the sultan of Cairo. The Nile, whose bank was
covered with intrenchments, presented a barrier very difficult
to be overcome. But Melic-Kamel did not dare to
match himself with the Crusaders; dreading their rash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
bravery, so accustomed to sport with perils and triumph over
all obstacles. Reports of the arrival of Frederick, and of
the approach of the Tartars, kept the Mussulmans in a continual
state of alarm, and made them anxious to terminate a
war which exhausted their resources, consumed their strength,
and did not promise them, even in victory, a compensation
for so many efforts and so many sacrifices.</p>

<p>Ambassadors were sent to propose peace to the leaders of
the Christian army: the Mussulmans offered their enemies,
if they would consent to an entire cessation of hostilities, to
give up to them Damietta and its territories, and to restore
Jerusalem, with all the places of Palestine that had been
conquered by Saladin.</p>

<p>These conditions assured to the Christians all the advantages
of both war and peace. The king of Jerusalem, and
most of the barons, who saw the difficulties and perils of the
expedition they had entered upon, listened with as much
surprise as joy to the proposals of the infidels, and did not
hesitate to accept them; but they had absolutely no power
in the army. The legate, who exercised an arbitrary authority,
and who was constantly dreaming of conquests, persisted in
thinking that these pacific proposals were only the effects of
fear, and that the enemy who sued for peace was the one
with whom war should be prosecuted with most spirit.</p>

<p>The ambassadors returned to the camp of the Mussulmans,
to announce that the Christians refused the peace: their
account excited indignation, and indignation roused courage.
When the Ayoubite princes proposed peace, they were in
possession of ample means to carry on the war with advantage;
they every day received reinforcements, and their
camp rapidly assumed a more formidable aspect; but soon a
terrible auxiliary, against whose attacks Pelagius had no defence,
came to the assistance of the Mussulmans, and procured
them a complete triumph without either battles or
danger.</p>

<p>The Christian warriors, who flattered themselves they
had now only to deal with a conquered enemy, were satisfied
with surrounding their camp with a ditch and a wall; the
army remained for several days in this position, without
making an effort either to attack the Saracens or pass the
Nile. Pelagius, who was constantly promising victory to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
his soldiers, remained, nevertheless, in a state of inactivity
in his tent. During this period, many of the Crusaders
grew weary of a war in which no battles were fought; some
fancied that the cause no longer stood in need of their
assistance; whilst others, with more foresight, feared coming
reverses: more than ten thousand Crusaders abandoned the
camp and returned to Damietta.</p>

<p>The Christian army had been for more than a month in
face of the enemy, always in expectation of the victories
that had been promised to them. At length, the overflowing
of the Nile, in a most alarming manner, disturbed their
imagined security. The Saracens opened the sluices, and
filled all the canals of Lower Egypt. The Mussulman fleet,
which had not been able to ascend the Nile by Damietta, took
advantage of the canals, and came up with the Christian ships.
In a single engagement, the vessels of the Crusaders were
almost all dispersed and consumed by the Greek fire: from
that moment terror seized upon the Christians, for they were
in want of provisions, and had neither means nor hopes of
obtaining any. The Saracens, after having crossed the Nile
on bridges, occupied all the circumjacent hills. The Christian
soldiers wandered about the fields at hazard, pursued by
the waves of the rising river, and by the Mussulmans, whose
bravery they had so lately held in contempt. The whole
army was on the point of being submerged or perishing with
hunger, and had no hope but in the clemency of an enemy
with whom they had recently refused to make peace.</p>

<p>In this extremity, the king of Jerusalem and the principal
leaders of the Christians sent several of their knights to offer
the Saracens battle; but the latter were neither sufficiently
imprudent, nor sufficiently generous to accept a proposal
dictated by despair. The Crusaders were exhausted with
hunger and fatigue; the cavalry sunk into, and encumbered
by mud and slime, could neither advance nor retreat; the
foot-soldiers cast away their arms; the baggage of the army
floated away upon the waters, and nothing was heard but
groans and lamentations. “When the Christian warriors,”
says an Arabian historian, “saw nothing before them but
death, their minds sank into a state of despondency, and
their backs bent beneath the rod of God, <i>to whom be all
praise</i>!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>Pelagius must then have been sensible of the full extent of
his error: his project of marching to Cairo had, doubtless,
something great in it, if it could have been executed; but
the presumptuous legate disdained all counsels, all lessons of
experience, and foresaw none of the obstacles he was certain
to meet with on his route; he conducted an army filled with
discontent; the soldiers had neither that confidence nor that
enthusiasm that leads men to brave dangers or cheerfully
encounter fatigue. The king of Jerusalem, the duke of
Bavaria, and a great number of the barons were his personal
enemies, and took very little interest in the success of an
enterprise of which they had disapproved.</p>

<p>Amidst the cries and lamentations of an army to which he
had promised victory, Pelagius was obliged to negotiate for
peace, and his pride humbled itself so far as to implore the
clemency of the Saracens. Christian ambassadors, among
whom was the bishop of Ptolemaïs, went to propose a capitulation
to the conquerors; they offered to give up the city
of Damietta, and only asked for the Christian army liberty
to return to Ptolemaïs.</p>

<p>The Mussulman princes assembled in council to deliberate
upon the proposals of the Crusaders. Some were of opinion
they should be accepted; others declared that all the Christians
ought to be made prisoners of war. Among those who
proposed the harshest measures, the sultan of Damascus, an
implacable enemy of the Franks, was conspicuous. “No
treaty can be made,” said he, “with warriors without
humanity and without faith. We should remember their
barbarities in war and their treachery in peace. They armed
themselves to ravage provinces, to destroy cities, and overthrow
the worship of Mahomet. Since fortune has placed
these most cruel enemies of Islamism, these devastators of
the East, in the hands of <i>the true believers</i>, we ought to immolate
them to the safety of the Mussulman nations, and
take an advantage of our victory that will create a terror
among the people of the West for ever.”</p>

<p>Most of the princes and emirs, animated by fanaticism
and vengeance, applauded this violent speech. The sultan of
Cairo, more moderate, and, doubtless, more prescient than
the other leaders, dreading likewise the arrival of Frederick
and the invasion of the Tartars, combated the opinion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
the sultan of Damascus, and advised that the capitulation of
the Franks should be accepted. “All the Franks were not
comprised in this army now in their power; other Crusaders
guarded Damietta, and might be able to defend it; the
Mussulmans had sustained a siege of eight months, the
Christians might hold out as long. It was more advantageous
for the princes of the family of Saladin to return to
their cities than to retain a few of their enemies in chains.
If they destroyed one Christian army, the West, to avenge
the defeat of its warriors, was able to send numberless
legions into the East. They ought not to forget that the
Mussulman armies had lost a portion of that spirit of
obedience and discipline that was the sole guarantee of victory;
that they were worn out with fatigue, and sighed for
repose. Other enemies than the now disarmed Christians,
other perils than those they had just escaped, might soon
hang over both Syria and Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> It was wise to make
peace at this moment, in order to prepare for fresh contests,
for new wars, perhaps much more cruel than that which they
had now an opportunity of terminating with so much glory
to the Mussulman arms.”</p>

<p>The speech of Melik-Kamel brought back the princes of
his family to sentiments of moderation.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> The capitulation
was accepted; the sultan of Cairo sent his own son to the
camp of the Christians as a pledge for his word. The king
of Jerusalem, the duke of Bavaria, the legate of the pope,
and the principal leaders repaired to the camp of the Saracens,
and remained as hostages till the accomplishment of
the treaty.</p>

<p>When the deputies of the imprisoned army came to Damietta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
and announced the disasters and captivity of the
Christians, their account drew tears from the crowd of
Crusaders who at that time arrived from the West. When
these same deputies informed them that the city must be
given up to the infidels, the most intrepid of the Franks
could not restrain their indignation, and refused to recognise
a treaty so disgraceful to the soldiers of the cross. The
greatest tumult prevailed throughout the city. Some, filled
with despair, determined to return to Europe, and prepared
to desert the banners of the cross; others ran towards the
ramparts, and getting possession of the towers, swore to
defend them.</p>

<p>A few days after, fresh deputies arrived to declare that the
king of Jerusalem and the other leaders of the army would
be obliged to give up Ptolemaïs to the Mussulmans if they
refused to surrender Damietta. In order to overcome the
obstinate resistance of those who wished to defend the city,
and who reproached the imprisoned army with disgracing
the Christians, they added, that this army, though defeated,
had obtained a prize worthy of their former exploits, for the
Saracens had engaged to restore to them the true cross of
the Saviour, which had fallen into the hands of Saladin at
the battle of Tiberias. The fear of losing Ptolemaïs, the
hope of regaining the cross of Christ, together with the
speeches of the deputies, brought back the spirit of peace
and resignation to the minds of the most ardent of the
Crusaders, and disposed them to the performance of the
conditions of the treaty.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the Christian army having lost their
tents and their baggage, passed many days and many nights
in a plain covered with the waters of the Nile. Hunger,
disease, and inundation threatened their entire destruction.
The king of Jerusalem, then in the camp of the Saracens,
upon being informed of the horrible distress of the Christians,
went to conjure Melik-Kamel to have pity on his
disarmed enemies. The continuator of William of Tyre,
who is our guide in this part of our history, reports, in his
old, quaint language, the touching interview between John
of Brienne and the sultan of Egypt. “The king sat down
before the sultan, and began to weep; the sultan, on seeing
the king weep, said, ‘Sire, why do you weep?’ ‘Sire, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
have good cause,’ replied the king, ‘for I behold the people
whom God has confided to me perishing amidst the waters,
and dying with hunger.’ The sultan felt great pity at seeing
the king weep, and he wept also; then he sent thirty thousand
loaves to the poor as well as the rich; and sent the
same quantity daily during four days.”<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>Melik-Kamel caused the sluices to be closed, and the
waters rapidly retired from the plain; as soon as Damietta
was surrendered to the Mussulmans, the Christian army
began its retreat. The Crusaders, who owed their liberty
and lives to the mercy of the Saracens, passed through the
city which had cost them so many conflicts and so much
labour; and, weeping, quitted the banks of the Nile, where
so short a time before they had sworn to make the cause of
Christ triumphant. They bore away in sadness the wood of
the true cross, the identity of which they had reason to
suspect, since it no longer performed miracles, and was not
for them now the signal of victory. The sultan of Egypt
caused them to be accompanied by his son, who had orders
to provide for all their wants on their route. The Saracen
leaders were impatient to get rid of an army that had threatened
their empire; they could scarcely give credit to their
own triumph, and some little apprehension was, no doubt,
mingled with the pity with which their conquered enemies
inspired them.</p>

<p>Great rejoicings had been made at Ptolemaïs for the victories
obtained by the Christians on the banks of the Nile;
they believed that they already saw the holy places delivered,
and the empire of the Saracens destroyed. Consternation
took place of their joy on seeing the army return. As in
all the other reverses which their arms had met with, the
Christians mutually reproached each other with their defeat;
they accused the leaders of ambition, and the king of Jerusalem
of weakness; the Templars and Hospitallers, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
on all occasions set an example of courage and the most
generous devotedness, were obliged to make a public apology
for their conduct. When it became known in the West that
Damietta had fallen again into the hands of the Saracens, all
the faithful were affected by the deepest grief,<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> and sought,
by their prayers, to mitigate the anger of Heaven. Violent
murmurs arose against the legate Pelagius, and represented
him to the sovereign pontiff as the author of all the disasters
of the crusade; but Honorius was not willing to condemn
his minister, and reproached Frederick, who had three times
renewed his vow to fight against the infidels, with having
remained an idle spectator of an unfortunate war, and with
having neglected to succour his brethren of the East.</p>

<p>Frederick, who had sent vessels, provisions, and soldiers
to the holy war, thought that he had fully performed his part
in the crusade, and was at first much astonished at the
reproaches of the Holy See. When the pope threatened
him with the anger of Heaven and the thunders of Rome,
he could not restrain his indignation; in his letters the
emperor complains bitterly of the tyranny of both Innocent
and Honorius, and talks of opposing war to war, and vengeance
to injustice. After this, Honorius, who acted less
from the dictates of his own mind than after the policy of
his predecessors, changed his tone, attempted to justify both
Innocent and himself, and, employing prayers instead of
menaces, conjured Frederick to have pity on the Church of
the East.</p>

<p>This paternal language appeased Frederick; in an interview
which he had with the pope at Veroli, the emperor of
Germany repeated his vow to repair to Palestine at the head
of an army. In another assembly, which was held some
time afterwards at Verona, the pope endeavoured to engage
Frederick, on account of his own interests; he proposed to
him to espouse Yolande, daughter of John of Brienne, and
heir to the kingdom of Jerusalem. The grand masters of
the Templars, the Hospitallers, and the Teutonic order, with
the patriarch and the king of Jerusalem, all summoned to
Italy to deliberate on the affairs of the crusade, approved of
a union which would secure them the assistance of a powerful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
monarch. Frederick accepted a kingdom which he promised
to defend, and consented to undergo excommunication if he
failed in his promises.</p>

<p>After the conference of Verona, King John of Brienne
visited the principal states of Europe, for the purpose of
soliciting aid for the Holy Land. At the time of John’s
arrival in France, the French were mourning the death of
Philip Augustus. The king of Jerusalem assisted at the
funeral ceremonies of his master and benefactor, who, at his
death, had bequeathed three thousand silver marks to the
defenders of Palestine. After having paid the last duties
to Philip, John went first to England, and afterwards to
Germany, in both of which countries his presence and his
discourses strongly moved Christians with the misfortunes
of the Holy Land.</p>

<p>The emperor Frederick, on his part, made all the requisite
preparations for an expedition which he was to lead in person;
he ordered vessels to be constructed in all the ports of
Sicily for transporting the Crusaders. “Heaven and earth,”
wrote he to the pope, “are witnesses that I desire the success
of the Christian arms with my whole soul, and that I
will neglect nothing that can assist in securing the success
of the holy enterprise.” In all his letters Frederick exhorted
the sovereign pontiff to employ every means to augment
the numbers of the soldiers of Christ. Become, all
at once, more zealous for the crusade than the pope himself,
he reproached the court of Rome with being sparing in indulgences,
and with confiding the preaching of the crusade
to vulgar orators; he advised the pope to redouble his efforts
to appease the quarrels of Christian princes, and to compel
the kings of France and England to sign a peace, in order
that the nobles and people of these two kingdoms might
take part in the crusade. Frederick not being able to go
into Germany, sent thither the grand master of the Teutonic
order, with directions to exhort the landgrave of
Thuringia, the duke of Austria, the king of Hungary, and
the other princes of the empire, to take the oath to fight
against the infidels. He undertook to furnish the Crusaders
with vessels, provisions, arms, and everything necessary for
the expedition beyond the sea; in short, he displayed so
much activity, and showed so much ardour and zeal, that all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
the attention of the Christians was directed towards him,
and he was considered as the soul, the moving principle, and
the head of the holy enterprise.</p>

<p>The Christians of Palestine placed all their hopes in him;
the patriarch of Alexandria, in a letter to the pope, said that
they looked for the emperor of Germany on the banks of the
Nile and the Jordan, <i>as formerly the saints had looked for
the coming of the Messiah or Saviour of the world</i>. The
patriarch spoke with grief of the oppression and servitude
that had been inflicted upon the Christians established in
Egypt since the last invasion of the Crusaders. The unfortunate
disciples of Christ were not allowed to keep in their
dwellings either arms or horses, nor even to bear a crucifix
at the funeral processions of their relations; a hundred and
fifteen of their churches had been destroyed since the conquest
of Damietta. Oppressed by tributes,<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> condemned to
disgraceful labours, banished from their homes, wandering
around their temples and their altars, they invoked the
mercy of Heaven and the valour of the warriors of the West
for their deliverance.</p>

<p>The report of Frederick’s preparations was spread even
to the remote nations of Georgia; and the queen of that
country wrote to the head of the Church of Rome, that the
constable of her kingdom and a great number of warriors
only waited for the arrival of the emperor of Germany, to
fly to the assistance of Palestine. The Georgians had the
reputation of being a warlike people, and were dreaded by
the Mussulmans; their pilgrims enjoyed the privilege of
entering Jerusalem without paying the tribute imposed
upon other Christians. When the sultan of Damascus
caused the ramparts of the holy city to be destroyed, the
warriors of Georgia swore to avenge the outrage committed
on the city of God; but an invasion of the Tartars prevented
them from leaving their own territories.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> Since that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
period, the hordes of Tartary having directed their ravages
towards other countries, the Crusaders of Caucasus and the
shores of the Caspian Sea promised to unite themselves in
the plains of Syria and Egypt, with the Crusaders from the
banks of the Rhine and the Danube.</p>

<p>Frederick, however, was not yet in a position to perform
his so often repeated promises; the kingdom of Sicily and
Naples contained germs of discord and rebellion; the republics
of Lombardy were openly opposed to the emperor
of Germany; and the Holy See, which observed with anxiety
the ambitious projects of Frederick upon Italy, encouraged
all the enemies of a power of which it dreaded the too close
neighbourhood. Thus, the policy of the court of Rome,
the revolts of Sicily, and the enterprises of the Italian
republics, would not allow the emperor to lead his armies
into Asia. Frederick demanded of the pope the indulgence
of a delay of two years for the performance of his vow;
founding his request upon the length of time required for
assembling his armies, and declared that he was not willing
to begin the war before the expiration of the truce made
with the Mussulmans; thus showing much more respect for
treaties with infidels, than had till that time been common
among Christians, indeed, more respect than he had himself
shown. The pope, although much dissatisfied, could not
refuse the delay the emperor demanded; he, however, dissembled
his anger, and contented himself with requiring
fresh promises, which were made, as all the rest had been,
with the greatest solemnity.</p>

<p>The new vows of Frederick were strengthened by his
marriage with the heir of the king of Jerusalem. The marriage
was celebrated at Rome, amidst the benedictions of the
clergy and the acclamations of the people; all the Christians
of the West heard of it with joy, and this union appeared
to them to be the most certain pledge of the victories the
Crusaders would gain over the infidels. John of Brienne,
who assisted at the ceremony, congratulated himself upon
having obtained an emperor for a son-in-law and a supporter;
but his joy was not of long duration. Frederick, after his
marriage, only saw in him the brother of that Gauthier de
Brienne, who had borne the title of king of Naples and
Sicily; he considered him as an enemy to his power, a dangerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
rival, and he disputed the possession of the kingdom
of Jerusalem with him. The pope was secretly pleased at
this claim or pretension, as he hoped it would promote the
interests of the crusade. Honorius was delighted to see the
ambition of the emperor mix itself up with the great designs
for the execution of which he was so anxious. Frederick
was therefore acknowledged king of Jerusalem. Thus John
of Brienne, who had always proved himself the most ardent
apostle of the holy war, deprived of his crown, and from
that time a stranger to the affairs of Palestine, was obliged
to wait in retirement and silence for a favourable opportunity
to avenge himself on his son-in-law, and recover his kingdom.</p>

<p>Frederick carried on his preparations for the holy war,
and appeared more than ever disposed to set out for the
East. The crusade was preached, in the name of the head
of the Church, in all the kingdoms of Europe; the sovereign
pontiff wrote to the princes to exhort them to suspend their
divisions and occupy themselves solely with the war beyond
the sea.</p>

<p>As hostilities had just been renewed between England and
France, Honorius ordered Louis VIII. to lay down his arms,
and threatened him with excommunication, if he did not
immediately make peace. The king of France, before he
obeyed the orders of the pope, was desirous of completing
the conquest of Poitou; and whilst the thunders of Rome
were growling over his head, the people and clergy were
returning Heaven thanks for his victories, in every church
of his kingdom.</p>

<p>The war against the English was not the only obstacle to
the departure of the French Crusaders for the Holy Land;
the exterminating crusade against the Albigeois was still
going on, and Louis VIII. took a more active interest in it
than his father Philip had done. When Louis VIII. had
concluded a truce with England, he at length resolved to
take the cross, and made a vow, not to go and fight against
the Saracens in Asia, but against the heretics in Languedoc.
In this crusade the king of France had the double advantage
of scarcely going out of his own territories, and of making
conquests that might some day enlarge his kingdom. The
lords and barons followed Louis into the southern provinces,
and thought no more about the deliverance of Jerusalem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>At the same time the envoys of the pope and the emperor
were busy in exhorting the nations of Germany to succour
the Christians of Palestine. Their orations, which at first
had great success, ended by diminishing both confidence and
enthusiasm. As the pope had recommended the preachers
to be prodigal of the indulgences of the Church, the people
beheld with astonishment the greatest criminals take the
cross, and swear to expiate their sins by the holy pilgrimage.
They remembered that St. Bernard had called thieves and
murderers to the defence of Christ; but opinions and
morals began to change, and that which had succeeded in
the preceding century was now only a source of reproach.
The monk of Upsberg, a contemporary author, informs us
that the facility granted to the most vicious of mankind to
redeem their crimes by taking up arms and the cross, only
served to increase great offences, and cool the zeal of the
true defenders of Christ.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p>The orators who preached the crusade in England gathered
more fruit from their labours, but owed great part of their
success to celestial phenomena, which came very opportunely
to second their eloquence. A luminous crucifix, with the
marks of the five wounds of the Saviour, appeared suddenly
in the heavens. This miraculous spectacle greatly inflamed
the enthusiasm of the people; and, if we may believe Matthew
Paris, more than sixty thousand English took the
oath to arm themselves for the deliverance of the tomb of
Christ.</p>

<p>Spain was constantly the seat of a sanguinary war
between the Moors and the Christians; the one party supported
by warriors from Africa, the other by knights and
soldiers from the provinces of France, fought battles every
day without destroying their means of either attack or
defence: amidst such wars, in which, by turns, Mahomet
and Christ were invoked, Spain was not likely to hear or
attend to the complaints and appeals of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Another enthusiasm than that of the crusades,&mdash;an ardent
desire for liberty,&mdash;then agitated the finest countries of Italy.
The greater part of the cities, acted upon by jealousy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
the other passions of republics, were all at war among themselves;
fighting sometimes for territory, and sometimes for
independence. In all these small states, parties attacked and
pursued each other with fury, and disputed the exercise of
power, sword in hand. Some of the cities, principalities,
and baronies invoked the authority of the pope, others that
of the emperor of Germany; the factions of the Guelphs
and the Ghibellines troubled every city, and created divisions
in most families. These discords and civil wars naturally
turned the attention of Christian nations from the crusades.</p>

<p>The cities of Lombardy had formed a powerful confederacy,
which gave Frederick continual cause of inquietude,
and detained him in the West; Honorius employed every
means in his power to re-establish peace, and direct men’s
minds towards his darling object; and at last succeeded in
getting the Lombard republics to join the emperor of Germany
for the deliverance of the holy places.</p>

<p>Although the people had lost some portion of their enthusiasm
for the holy war, it was still possible to form a redoubtable
army, by gathering together all the warriors that had
taken the cross in the various countries of Europe; and the
new Crusaders were ordered to meet at the port of Brindisi,
where vessels were being prepared to transport them to the
East. On their arrival in the kingdom of Naples, the emperor
of Germany supplied them with provisions and arms;
everything was ready, and the pope was about, at length, to
see his wishes accomplished, and receive the reward of all
his labours and preachings, when inexorable death deprived
Christendom of its head.</p>

<p>Gregory IX., who succeeded him, had all the abilities, the
virtues, and the ambition of Innocent III. In the execution
of his designs, he feared neither difficulties nor perils; the most
violent measures had no terrors for his obstinacy or audacity,
when the triumph of his will was in question. Gregory had
scarcely ascended the pontifical throne, when the preparations
for the holy war engrossed all his thoughts, and became the
principal object of his active solicitude.</p>

<p>The Crusaders assembled in Apulia had much to suffer
from the influences of the climate and the season; the sovereign
pontiff neglected nothing to alleviate their distresses
and hasten their departure. He exhorted the emperor to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
embark, by saying to him, “The Lord has placed you in this
world as a cherubim with a flaming sword, to direct those
who stray from the way of the tree of life.” Frederick at
length yielded to the prayers of the pope, and sailed from
the port of Brindisi with his fleet and army. Prayers were
being put up for the prosperity of his voyage and the success
of his expedition, in all the provinces of his empire, when,
at the end of three days, being attacked by the malady that
had made such ravages in the Christian army, he retraced
his course, and landed in the port of Otranto.</p>

<p>Gregory had celebrated the departure of Frederick as a
triumph of the Church; he considered his return as an
absolute revolt against the Holy See. The little city of
Agnani, to which the pope had retired, witnessed the rage of
the pontiff, and beheld the birth of that formidable storm
which so long disturbed the Christian world. Accompanied
by the cardinals and several bishops, Gregory repaired to the
principal church, and having mounted the pulpit, before the
assembled people, he pronounced a sermon which had for its
text, “It is necessary that scandals should arise.” After
having called upon the prophets, and spoken of the triumph
of St. Michael over the dragon, he launched against Frederick
all the anathemas of the Church.</p>

<p>The emperor at first sent messengers to the pope to explain
and justify his conduct; but the inexorable Gregory
refused to listen to them, and complained to all the sovereigns
of Europe, representing Frederick as a faithless and
perjured prince. He accused him of having consigned his
wife Yolande to close imprisonment, in which she died of
grief; of having left the Crusaders to perish with hunger,
thirst, and heat in the plains of Apulia; and of having, at
last, under the frivolous pretext of sickness, violated his oath
and deserted the banners of Christ, <i>in order to return to the
customary enjoyments of his kingdom</i>. He made him many
other reproaches; and in his anger called down upon him
the maledictions of all Christians.</p>

<p>Frederick, exceedingly irritated, replied to the accusations
of Gregory with much bitterness. In his apology, which
he sent to all the princes of Christendom, he complained
strongly of the usurpations of the Holy See, and exposed, in
the most odious colours, the policy and ambitious designs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
the court of Rome. “The Church of Rome,” said he, “sends
legates everywhere, <i>with power to punish, to suspend, and
excommunicate, not with the designs of spreading the word of
God, but to heap up money, and reap that which they have not
sown</i>.” The emperor reminded the princes, in his letters, of
the violences which the pope had exercised against the count
of Thoulouse and the king of England; he said that the
domains of the clergy did not now satisfy the ambition of
the Holy See, and that the sovereign pontiffs wished to lay
their hands upon every kingdom. From that moment open
war was declared between the pope and the emperor; neither
of them possessed a pacific character or a love of quiet;
both were animated by boundless ambition, jealous to excess
of their power, implacable in their revenge, and always ready
to employ the arms which the Church or fortune placed in
their hands. Gregory displayed an indefatigable activity,
leaving his enemies no repose, but pursuing them at the
same time with the thunders of religion and war. In addition
to the arms of eloquence, the pontiff did not disdain to
employ satire; the manifestoes which he published against
his adversaries constantly recalled the spirit of the denunciations
made by the prophets. These denunciations, mixed
with obscure allegories, gave to his words a dark and mysterious
tone, which caused him to be considered as the interpreter
of angry Heaven. Frederick was neither a less
able prince nor a less redoubtable enemy: the art of war
contained no stratagems or secrets with which he was unacquainted;
policy dictated no means that he scrupled to
employ. Endowed with all the gifts of mind, and with a
keen spirit of raillery, he was as competent to confound his
enemies in a discussion, as to conquer them in the field of
battle. Descended, on the female side, from those famous
Normans who had conquered Sicily and the kingdom of
Naples, he united, as they had done, courage with subtlety,
and audacity with dissimulation: to please the court of
Rome, he had made barbarous laws against heretics; and,
now become the enemy of the popes, he did not fear to arm
heretics or Saracens against the court of Rome. When
the kingdom of Jerusalem was offered to him, he set no
great value upon the acquisition; but he accepted it with
joy, in order to increase his popularity in the Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
world, and to arm himself, one day, against the sovereign
pontiff with a title, which was then held in universal veneration.</p>

<p>A war between such enemies must necessarily prove terrible,
and spread desolation and confusion throughout Christendom.
Gregory, on his return to Rome, repeated his
excommunications in the church of St. Peter; Frederick,
in order to revenge himself, seduced into his party most of
the Roman nobles, who took up arms, insulted the sovereign
pontiff at the very foot of the altar, and compelled him to
abandon the capital of the Christian world. The pope,
driven from his states, pursued his enemy with more fury
than ever; and, availing himself of the formidable authority
of the Church, he released the subjects of Frederick from
their oath of fidelity, by reminding them that they could
owe no obedience to those who <i>opposed themselves to God
and his saints</i>. On his side, Frederick drove the Templars
and Hospitallers from the kingdom of Naples, plundered the
churches, and ill-treated all ecclesiastics whom he suspected
of being attached to the party of the Holy See. He sent
troops to ravage the patrimony of St. Peter, and enlisted
the Saracens established in Sicily, under the banners of a
Christian prince, to combat the head of the Christian church.
The Roman states were ravaged, and given up to the horrors
of war. The eyes of all Europe were fixed upon these
deplorable scenes, and every one seemed to have forgotten
the holy war.</p>

<p>The Christians of Palestine, however, never ceased to implore
aid from the West. A letter to the pope from the
patriarch of Jerusalem, the bishops of Cæsarea and Bethlehem,
and the grand masters of the three military orders,
painted in strong colours the despair into which the Christians
of the East had fallen, when they learnt that Frederick
had deferred his departure. The pope received their complaints
with expressions of sorrow and kindness, and communicated
them to the faithful with greater zeal, from their
furnishing him with a fresh opportunity of accusing the
emperor of Germany. But the nations of the West, occupied
with their own dangers, and terrified at the sight of the
violent storms that had recently burst forth, were not in the
least moved by either the lamentations from Palestine or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
the pressing exhortations of Gregory. In this unfortunate
position of European affairs, the Christian colonies, abandoned
to themselves and their own feeble resources, and a
prey to the greatest disorders, must have been invaded and
entirely destroyed, if Providence had not stirred up fresh
discords among their enemies.</p>

<p>During the siege of Damietta, the common danger had
united the children of Malek-Adel; after victory, ambition
resumed the place of fear; and the Ayoubite princes quarrelled
for the provinces which their union had wrested from
the power, or saved from the invasion of the Christians.
Conraddin, sultan of Damascus, dreading the views of
Melik-Kamel, called Gelaleddin, prince of the vast empire
of Carismia, to his aid. The sultan of Cairo, in great apprehension
of the consequences of this alliance, turned his
eyes towards the princes of the West. During several
years, the report alone of the preparations of Frederick had
been a source of terror to the Mussulman powers. The
emperor of Germany was considered, in the East, as the
head of all the nations of Europe. The sultan of Egypt
attached the greatest importance to the disarming of a formidable
enemy; and as the complaints of the pope, and the
report of the discords that had broken out among the Christians,
had reached his ears, he conceived a hope of finding
in Frederick a sincere ally and a powerful auxiliary.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p>Melik-Kamel sent presents and ambassadors to the
emperor of Germany; he invited Frederick to come into
the East, and promised to deliver Jerusalem up to him.
This proposition gave the emperor as much surprise as
joy; and he, in reply, sent an ambassador into Egypt, to
ascertain the exact intentions of the sultan of Cairo, and
offer him his friendship. The envoy of Frederick was
received at the court of the sultan with the greatest
honours, and returned to announce to his master that Melik-Kamel
was ready to favour his expedition to Palestine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>This negotiation, with which the pope and the Christians
of the West were perfectly unacquainted, made Frederick
determine to follow up the project of the crusade: he had,
besides, several other motives for not renouncing the
Eastern enterprise. He knew that John of Brienne was
on the point of returning to Palestine, and resuming possession
of the kingdom of Jerusalem. The pope continued
to represent him as the enemy of Christ, and the scourge
of Christians. To secure the failure of the plan of John
of Brienne, and, at the same time, reply to the sovereign
pontiff in a victorious manner, Frederick resolved to embark
for the Holy Land. He was desirous of proclaiming his
intention with the greatest pomp; and caused a magnificent
throne to be erected in the plain of Barletta, which he
ascended in the presence of an immense crowd of spectators.
In all the splendour of imperial magnificence, he presented
himself invested with the pilgrim’s cross, and announced to
the assembled people that he was about to set out for Syria.
In order to give more solemnity to this pompous ceremony,
and affect the hearts of the multitude, the emperor caused
his will to be read with a loud voice; and the barons and
nobles swore at the foot of the throne, to see that his last
commands should be executed, if he should chance to lose
his life, either in the perils of the sea or the wars of the
East.</p>

<p>When the pope learnt this determination of Frederick’s,
he sent ecclesiastics to forbid him to embark. The sovereign
pontiff reproached the emperor with presenting to the
Christian world the scandal of a crusade directed by a prince
reproved of God: as the fleet of Frederick consisted of
only twenty galleys, and as he took with him only six hundred
knights, Gregory reproached him with not having fulfilled
his promises, and compared his imprudent attempts to
the expedition of a captain of pirates. The emperor did
not condescend to make any reply to the messengers of the
pope; the more opposition the head of the Church gave to
his departure, the more impatient Frederick appeared to set
out and accomplish his design: in his indignation, he congratulated
himself at having to brave the anger of the
Church and the arms of the Saracens at the same time. He
left the greater part of his army in Sicily; charging his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
lieutenant, the duke of Spoleto, to negotiate for peace with
the pope, but at the same time to carry on the war commenced
against the Roman states with unabated vigour.</p>

<p>When he heard of the departure of the emperor, Gregory
was in the little city of Assisi, occupied in the canonization
of St. Francis. During several days, he had sung nothing
but hymns of hope and joy: “Francis,” said he, “had appeared
like the star of morning, like the orb of day, like the
moon in its splendour.” This language of peace, this festive
pomp, were all at once interrupted by the maledictions
that the pope pronounced against Frederick: the sovereign
pontiff repaired to the foot of the altar, and there implored
Heaven to confound the pride of impious monarchs, and
frustrate all their sacrilegious enterprises.</p>

<p>The emperor, notwithstanding, arrived safely on the coast
of Syria, and was received at Ptolemaïs by the patriarch,
the clergy, and the grand masters of the military orders.
For some days, the Christians of the East viewed him as
the liberator and the king of Jerusalem; but a change
speedily took place. Two disciples of St. Francis, sent by
the pope, came to announce to the faithful that they had
received a prince rebellious to the will of the Church. From
that moment, contempt, hatred, and mistrust took place of
respect and submission. They began by perceiving that
Frederick was followed by only a small number of warriors,
and that he had not troops enough to render him formidable
to either the Saracens or the Christians. Nothing was
talked of in Ptolemaïs but the excommunication of the
pope, and the means of withdrawing themselves from obedience
to a heretic prince: never had the deliverance of
Jerusalem been less thought of.</p>

<p>At the moment in which Frederick arrived in Syria,
Conraddin, sultan of Damascus, died; and the death of this
prince gave birth to more discords among the Mussulman
powers. The principality of Damascus was governed by a
young inexperienced prince; and the spirit of license and
insubordination, which had, in the last wars, been already
observed among the troops of Syria and Egypt, made, every
day, greater progress, and put all the Mussulman thrones in
peril.</p>

<p>The sultan of Cairo, when informed of the arrival of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
Frederick, came into Palestine, at the head of an army.
Some asserted that he came to defend Jerusalem, and to
fight with the Christians; but his true design was to take
advantage of the chances of war, and of the discords which
everywhere prevailed, to get possession of Damascus, and
defeat the plans of the enemies that jealousy and ambition
had raised up against him among the Mussulmans and
princes of his family.</p>

<p>The emperor of Germany marched out of Ptolemaïs, at
the head of his small army, and directed his course towards
the mountains of Naplouse. He had sent Count Thomas
de Celano to Melik-Kamel, to remind him of his promises,
and to tell him, that, being master of the most vast provinces
of the West, he was not come into Asia for the purpose of
making conquests; that he had no other design but that of
visiting the holy places, and taking possession of the kingdom
of Jerusalem, which belonged to him.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> The sultan
received the ambassador of Frederick with due respect;
but whether he was ashamed to make peace before he had
begun the war, or whether he feared to draw upon himself
the hatred of the Mussulmans, by showing too much deference
for a Christian prince, he at first made no reply to the
propositions that were made to him.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the two princes sent fresh ambassadors,
charged on both sides to express a desire for peace; both
were placed in embarrassing circumstances, being surrounded
by enemies who blamed their proceedings, and did not allow
them to publish all their sentiments freely. The Mussulman
army from Damascus, encamped in the neighbourhood
of Jerusalem, watched all the movements of the sultan of
Egypt, and seemed much more disposed to fight with him
than to repulse the Christians. The emperor of Germany
found himself in the presence of two hostile armies, and that
which he himself commanded inspired him with no more
confidence than he inspired in it. The Hospitallers and
Templars had left him, and followed him at a distance; in
the camp of the Christians no one durst pronounce the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
name of the prince who commanded the army. Frederick
had been obliged to withdraw the standard of the empire,
and his orders were only issued to the soldiers of the cross
in the name of God and of the Christian republic.</p>

<p>In this difficult situation, Frederick and Melik-Kamel
were equally sensible of the necessity for peace, and of the
danger of commencing war; they therefore gave more employment
to their ambassadors than to their soldiers; this
crusade was nothing but a long negotiation, disapproved of
by both Christians and infidels. As the two sovereigns
covered their policy with a veil of profound mystery, it was
easy for hatred to spread and procure countenance for sinister
reports. Criminal intentions were discovered in the
simplest actions. In the Christian army it was conceived
that Frederick had committed a crime by sending his sword
and cuirass to the sultan of Cairo, as a pledge of his wish
for peace. Among the Mussulmans, Melik-Kamel was reproached
with seeking an alliance with the enemies of
Islamism, by sending to the leader of the Franks an elephant,
some camels, and the rarest productions of Arabia,
India, and Egypt. The scandal reached its height when the
emperor received as a present from the sultan of Cairo, a
troop of girls, brought up, according to the custom of the
Orientals, to sing and dance in the banqueting-hall.</p>

<p>At length prejudices were carried so far on both sides,
that Frederick was judged more favourably of by his enemies
than by his own army; and Melik-Kamel would sooner
have found grace among the Christians than among his own
troops. The infidels regarded the emperor of Germany as a
prince full of wisdom and moderation; Abulfeda, and all the
Arabian authors, have celebrated the qualities and virtues of
the monarch of the Franks, whilst the continuator of William
of Tyre only speaks of this prince with bitterness, and
reports in his history, that all the apostles and other Christians
had great doubt and great suspicion that he was far
gone in infidelity, and warm in his belief in the law of
Mahomet.</p>

<p>Hatred soon broke out in acts of treachery and the most
odious plots. As the emperor had expressed an intention of
going to bathe in the waters of the Jordan, the Templars
addressed a letter to Melik-Kamel, pointing out the means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
of surprising the head of the Christian array in his pilgrimage:
the sultan of Cairo despised such treachery, and
sent the letter he had received to Frederick. At the same
time Melik-Kamel learnt that the sultan of Damascus had
declared war against him, and would be joined by several
other Mussulman princes. The sultan of Cairo and the
emperor of Germany had carried on their negotiations
for peace during several months, but now, pressed on all
sides by enemies, and surrounded by dangers, even in their
own camp, they at length resolved to end the matter, and
conclude a treaty, which would permit them to dispose of
their forces for their security or for their personal ambition.
They agreed between themselves, that they would make a
truce of ten years, and that Jerusalem, Nazareth, Bethlehem,
and Thoron should be given up to Frederick or his lieutenants.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>
According to the conditions of the treaty, the
Mussulmans were to retain in the holy city, the mosque of
Omar and the free exercise of their worship: the principality
of Antioch and the county of Tripoli were not comprised
in the treaty. The emperor of Germany undertook
to divert the Franks from every kind of hostility against
the subjects or lands of the sultan of Egypt.</p>

<p>When the articles of the treaty became known in the two
camps, the peace was considered by both as impious and
sacrilegious.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> The imauns and cadis, invoking the name of
the caliph of Bagdad, loudly condemned a truce which conveyed
away from the Mussulmans the holy city, which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
called <i>the house of God, the city of the prophet</i>. The prelates
and bishops, speaking in the name of the pontiff of Rome,
declaimed vehemently against a treaty which left mosques
standing by the side of the Holy Sepulchre, and in some
sort confounded the worship of Mahomet with that of Christ.
When the envoy of the emperor of Germany went to Damascus,
to procure the ratification of the treaty which had been
concluded, the sultan and his vizier refused to hear him.
The peace made with the Christians was a subject of affliction
and scandal for all true believers. One of the most
celebrated orators of Islamism pronounced the panegyric of
Jerusalem in the great mosque; and, when recalling in
pathetic terms the loss the Mussulmans had experienced, he
drew tears from all the assembled people.</p>

<p>The patriarch of Jerusalem placed an interdict upon the
recovered holy places, and refused pilgrims permission to
visit the sepulchre of Christ. Jerusalem was no longer, in
the eyes of Christians, the holy city and the heritage of the
Son of God; when the emperor made his public entrance,
the faithful preserved a sullen and melancholy silence as he
passed along. Accompanied by the German barons and the
Teutonic knights, he repaired to the church of the Holy
Sepulchre, which was hung with mourning, and appeared as
if guarded by the angel of reprobation; all the ecclesiastics
had deserted the sanctuary, and everything wore the air of
abomination and desolation. Frederick himself took the
crown, and placing it upon his head, he was proclaimed king
of Jerusalem without any religious ceremony; the images of
the apostles were veiled; nothing was seen around the altars
but swords and lances; and the sacred vaults gave back no
sounds but the noisy acclamations of warriors.</p>

<p>After his coronation, Frederick wrote to the pope and to
all the princes of the West, that he had reconquered Jerusalem
without the effusion of blood; in his account he endeavoured
to enhance the splendour and merit of this victory,
which must fulfil all the hopes of the Christian world.
At the same time, the patriarch wrote to Gregory, and all
the faithful of Christendom, to show them the impiety and
the disgrace of the treaty Frederick had just concluded.
When he heard of the success of the emperor, the sovereign
pontiff deplored the conquest of Jerusalem as he would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
deplored its loss, and compared the new king of Judæa to
those impious monarchs whom the anger of God placed upon
the throne of David.</p>

<p>Frederick was not able to remain long in the holy city,
which resounded with imprecations against him. He returned
to Ptolemaïs, where he found only revolted subjects
and Christians scandalized at his successes. The patriarch
and the clergy placed an interdict upon the city during the
time the emperor should remain in it; all religious worship
was suspended; the altars were deprived of their ornaments,
and the crosses, relics, and images of the saints were cast
upon the ground; no more bells, no more religious hymns
were to be heard; a melancholy silence prevailed in the
sanctuary, where mass was celebrated in a low voice, and
with closed doors. The dead were buried in the fields,
without funeral ceremonies or monumental stones; everything,
in short, denoted a season of great calamities, and a
dread of the vengeance of Heaven: it was thus that the
liberator of Jerusalem was welcomed at Ptolemaïs.</p>

<p>It was Passion-week, and this religious period gave additional
influence to the clergy and more solemnity to the
maledictions of the Church. Frederick found himself obliged
to negotiate for peace with the Christians, as he had done
with the infidels, and being unable to regain their good-will
he still further exasperated them by his violence. He caused
the gates of the city to be closed, and prohibited the bringing
in of provisions; he planted archers and arbalatiers in
every place where they could insult the Templars and pilgrims;
and by his orders, mendicant preaching monks were
dragged from the foot of the altar, and beaten with rods in
the public places of the city.</p>

<p>Hatred and vengeance were carried, on both sides, to the
greatest excess. It was impossible for the emperor, surrounded
as he was by enemies, to remain long at Ptolemaïs,
in addition to which motive, he daily received letters from
Europe urging his return. Two formidable armies, under
the banners of the Holy See, had entered the kingdom of
Naples, pillaged the cities, ravaged the country, mutilated
prisoners, and committed all kinds of enormities. These
armies were under the command of John of Brienne, impatient
to revenge his own injuries, and two Sicilian counts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
whom the emperor of Germany had driven from the kingdom
of Naples.</p>

<p>Frederick at length quitted Palestine and returned to his
own dominions. As he left Ptolemaïs, the inhabitants
chanted hymns of deliverance and joy. He accused the
Templars of having endeavoured to deliver him up to the
Saracens; the Templars, on their part, accused him of
having wished to surrender all the Christian cities to the
sultan of Cairo: these accusations, and a thousand others,
dictated by hatred, ought to inspire the historian with great
and just suspicions. The Christians might have urged
against Frederick a much more reasonable reproach; he had
taken no means to secure his conquest, and they were warranted
in believing that he had only made his triumphal
entry into Jerusalem with the view of annoying the Holy
See, and dating a reply to the inculpations of Gregory from
the holy places: having attained his object, he had deceived
the faithful, by inviting them to a city that he was disposed
neither to defend nor fortify. In addition to this, Frederick
himself felt very little pride in the advantages of which he
made such a pompous display throughout Europe; and the
crusade in which he had taken a part was frequently the
object of his pleasantries and sarcasms.</p>

<p>On his return to Italy, he found a much more serious war
than that he had carried on in Asia. The pope had not only
levied troops to ravage his states, he had induced the Lombard
republics to take up arms against him. John of
Brienne, deprived of his title of king of Jerusalem, determined
to endeavour to be acknowledged emperor, and his
pretensions were supported by all that was then held most
sacred, the authority of the Church and the right of victory.
The presence of Frederick restored courage to his subjects,
whose fidelity was still unshaken; he met his enemies in
several engagements, in which he always gained the advantage.
The army of John of Brienne was dispersed, and the
pontifical troops quitted all the cities and provinces they had
conquered, in the greatest disorder.</p>

<p>The pope, learning that fortune had deserted his banners,
again had recourse to the thunders of religion, and employed
the most terrible of its denunciations against Frederick. He
declared that all were excommunicated who should hold any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
kind of commerce with the emperor, all who should sit at
his table, be present at his councils, celebrate divine service
before him, or offer him any mark of attachment or respect.
Frederick was terrified at this sentence, which was published
with great solemnity in all parts of Europe, particularly in
his own dominions; and sent ambassadors to the pope, who,
in spite of the thunders with which he was armed, dreaded
the consequences of war, and showed himself disposed to
receive the submission of an enemy he dreaded.</p>

<p>After a negotiation of several days, a treaty was made, in
which the conquered pope dictated laws to his conqueror,
and appeared, whilst receiving peace, to accord a pardon.
But in spite of this treaty of peace, the effects of discord
still subsisted, and were felt even in the East, where debates,
raised in the name of the Church, had divided men’s minds,
and depressed the general courage; and where the Christian
states, for which Europe had taken up arms, remained
without support and without defence. As Frederick had
abandoned Jerusalem without fortifying it,<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> the Christians
were in constant dread of the invasion of the Mussulman
peasants, whom the hopes of pillage attracted from the
mountains of Naplouse. The great bell of the church of
the Holy Sepulchre often gave warning of the approach of
an enemy eager for carnage; and most of the inhabitants
retired with their terrified families, some to the fortress of
St. David, which was still standing among the ruins, and
others into desert places.</p>

<p>The patriarch of Jerusalem, the prelates, barons, and
people of Palestine, who had no longer either a leader or a
king, in vain implored the assistance of the warriors and
princes of the West: prayers and complaints so frequently
repeated, had no power to awaken in the hearts of the faithful
either the sentiments of pity or the enthusiasm which
had so often caused them to take up arms and the cross.
They could have no faith in perils that followed so closely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
upon victory; and they despaired of ever being able to
assure the deliverance of a country which required to be
delivered so often.</p>

<p>The pope, however, had not abandoned the project of the
crusade, and still entertained the hope of reviving the
ardour and zeal of the Christian warriors by his exhortations.
He convoked an assembly at Spoleto, at which Frederick,
with the patriarchs of Constantinople, Antioch, and Jerusalem
assisted. It was resolved in this assembly, to renew
the war in Palestine, notwithstanding the truce concluded
with the sultan of Cairo.</p>

<p>Gregory was impatient to accomplish his designs, and
proclaim the laws of the Church in the rich countries of the
East; and, to employ the time till warriors could be gathered
together, he sent several missionaries across the sea, armed
with the sword and the word, to endeavour to convert the
infidels of Syria and Egypt. The sovereign pontiff was so
persuaded of the success of this pacific crusade, that he
wrote to the caliph of Bagdad, the sultan of Damascus,
and the principal Mussulman chiefs, to exhort them to embrace
Christianity.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> History does not say what the fate
was of these mendicant preachers in the East; but the
caliph of Bagdad and the Mussulman princes did not cease
to be inveterate enemies to the Christians. Gregory IX.
was better inspired and more fortunate when he sent sacred
orators into several of the provinces of the West, to appease
the troubles and civil wars that were so injurious to the cause
of religion, and diverted the minds of the people from the
great enterprise of the holy wars.</p>

<p>The disciples of St. Dominick and St. Francis of Assisi,
charged with a mission worthy of the Gospel, pervaded cities
and countries, preaching peace and concord. Among the
preachers thus sent to pacify states, Brother John of Vicentia
made himself conspicuous by the miracles effected by his
eloquence.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> In all the countries he visited, the nobles, the
peasants, the citizens, and the warriors flocked to listen to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
him, and swore to pardon all injuries and terminate all
quarrels. After having re-established peace in several cities
troubled by the spirit of jealousy, and animated by the
stormy passions of undefined, ill-understood liberty, he announced
that he should preach in the plain of Peschiera, on
the banks of the Adige. All the inhabitants of the neighbouring
cities, headed by their clergy and their magistrates,
repaired to the place appointed, to listen to the <i>Angel of
Concord</i><a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> and the orator of public peace. In the presence of
more than four hundred thousand auditors, Brother John
mounted a pulpit elevated in the centre of the plain of
Peschiera; a profound silence prevailed throughout the
assembly; every eye was fixed upon the holy preacher; his
words seemed to descend from heaven. He took for his
text these words of the Scripture: “I give you my peace, I
leave you my peace.” After having drawn a frightful picture
of the evils of war and the effects of discord, he ordered
the Lombard cities to renounce their enmities, and dictated
to them, in the name of the Church, a treaty of universal
pacification. At no period had the middle ages presented
a more sublime and touching spectacle; the historian of that
time, who has nothing but troubles and wars to describe,
ought to be delighted at an opportunity to tell of such an
imposing and solemn scene, wherein religion recalled assembled
nations to a sense of all that her maxims contain that
is most consoling and salutary. The discourse of Brother
John filled his auditory with a holy love of peace, and the
cities then at war swore, before him, to forget for ever the
subjects of their long divisions and eternal rivalries.</p>

<p>These evangelical discourses restored to Italy a few days
of peace, and gave the Holy See an opportunity of preaching
a new crusade with success. Gregory addressed pastoral
instructions to all the bishops and prelates of Christendom.
In his letters to the French bishops, he applied these words
of Christ to the holy war: “If any one would come with
me, let him renounce himself, let him take up my cross and
follow me.” The sovereign pontiff declared all who would
not employ their utmost efforts to conquer the heritage of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
Christ, guilty of treason. The circulars of the pope ordered
all the faithful, of both sexes, to pay a denier per week
towards the expenses of the crusade. The head of the
Church compared these alms to those which St. Paul
solicited for the poor of Jerusalem, and did not fear to
assert, beforehand, that they would suffice for the maintenance
of the army of Crusaders for ten years.</p>

<p>The preaching of this crusade was confided to the fraternities
of St. Dominick and St. Francis, which had, in Asia,
missionaries for the conversion of infidels, and in the West,
preachers to re-establish peace among Christians; the new
apostles of the holy war received from the pope the power,
not only to give the cross, but to commute the vow of pilgrimage
to a pecuniary alms, a practice that had never been
seen since the beginning of the crusades; they had likewise
the faculty of granting indulgences for several days to all
who came to listen to their sermons. According to the spirit
of their institutions, the disciples of St. Francis and St.
Dominick lived amidst austerities and penance; they devoted
themselves to poverty, and were bound to furnish a
constant example of Christian humility; but, in this instance,
the pope desired they should be received into monasteries
and cities with pomp and ceremony; and that the
clergy should come out to meet them, with the banners and
most splendid ornaments of their churches. Whether this
magnificence changed the simplicity of their manners, or
that the people did not like to behold men whom they had
lately seen devoted to evangelical poverty, treated with
ceremonial pomp, the preachers of the crusade inspired their
auditors with neither esteem nor respect, and the crowd
diminished every day. As they received abundant alms, of
which no one could see the employment, neither the
solemnity of their mission nor the sanctity of their characters
could screen them from the suspicions and accusations
of the multitude: the murmurs and complaints which arose
on all sides, at length weakened the authority of their words,
and assisted in cooling the zeal and devotion of the Christians
for the holy war.</p>

<p>The enthusiasm of the people, which Christian eloquence
could not revive, stood in need of the example of the most
illustrious princes and warriors. France was then at peace;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
the war against the Albigeois was drawing towards its end:
most of the knights and barons, reared amidst battles, could
not endure rest, and sighed for an opportunity of signalizing
their warlike temperament. They took the oath to go into
Asia and fight against the Saracens.</p>

<p>Thibault V., count of Champagne, and king of Navarre,
son of Thibault, who died before the fifth crusade, undertook
to discharge the vow his father had made to the Church
and to Christ. The king of Navarre was celebrated among
knights and among troubadours; his muse, which had sung
profane loves, now gave voice to the complaints of Jerusalem,
and awakened, by Christian songs, the ardour of the soldiers
of the cross. “Learn,” said he, “that heaven is closed to
all those who will not cross the seas to visit and defend the
tomb of God. Yes, all the brave, all who love God and
glory, will not hesitate to take up the cross and arms.
Those who prefer repose to honour, those who dread perils,
will remain alone in their homes. Jesus Christ, in the day
of judgment, will say to the one party: ‘You, who helped
me to bear my cross, go to the place in which dwell the
angels and my mother Mary;’ he will say to the others:
‘You, who have not succoured me, descend to the abode of
the wicked.’”<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> The example and the exhortations of
Thibault attracted princes, barons, and knights from all the
provinces of France.</p>

<p>Pierre de Dreux, duke of Brittany, whom the clergy surnamed
Mauclerc, because, in his youth, he had abandoned
the ecclesiastical state, wished to expiate his numerous
felonies, his unjust wars, his tyranny towards his subjects,
his perfidies towards his allies, by the holy pilgrimage.
Hugh IV., duke of Burgundy, the counts of Bar, Ferez,
Mâcon, Joigny, Sancoure, and Nevers; Simon de Montfort,
Andrew de Vitri, Amaury fils, Geoffrey d’Ancenes, and
a crowd of barons and knights took the cross, and engaged
to follow the duke of Brittany and the king of Navarre into
Palestine.</p>

<p>As the preaching of the crusade had been accompanied
by several abuses that might prove injurious to the success<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
of the holy expedition, a council assembled at Tours, employed
itself in remedying and stopping the evil at its
source. We have seen, on preceding occasions, that
preachers of the crusades, by receiving criminals under the
banners of the cross, had scandalized Christian knights;
and crusades, as was seen in the twelfth century, were not
considered as a means of salvation for the faithful, and as the
way of the Lord, in which all the world might enter. Great
criminals no longer found a place in the ranks of the pious
defenders of Christ. The council of Tours decided that
Crusaders, arrested by justice, should be transferred to the
hands of an ecclesiastical judge, who would pay no respect
to their privileges, and should even take the cross from
them, if he found them guilty of homicide or any other
great crime committed against divine and human laws.</p>

<p>As in other crusades, the people were led into violent
excesses against the Jews, whom they accused of having
immolated the God for whom they were going to fight, and
who retained immense treasures in their hands, whilst the
Crusaders were obliged to pledge their property to perform
the voyage to Palestine. In order to stop the course of
these popular violences, the council forbade any ill-treatment
of the Jews, either by plundering them of their wealth or
by doing them personal injury, under pain of heavy ecclesiastical
censures.</p>

<p>Another abuse, not less prejudicial to the Crusaders than
all the others, had been likewise observed. The preachers
of the holy wars and many other theologians had permitted
Crusaders to buy off their vow by paying a sum of money
equal to that which they would have expended in their pilgrimage:<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>
this abuse caused great scandal among the faithful,
but the Holy See, which derived considerable sums from
it, paid no attention to the complaints made on account of
it in England and many other states of Europe.</p>

<p>The Crusaders were preparing for their departure, when,
all at once, a fresh cry of alarm resounded through the
West. The empire of the Latins, at Constantinople, was
reduced to the lowest extremity. After the reigns of Baldwin
of Flanders and his son Henry, the family of Courtenay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
called to the throne, derived nothing from their exaltation
but the griefs and reverses inseparable from the government
of an empire which is hastening to decay. Peter of Courtenay,
count of Auxerre, when on his way to take possession of the
throne of Baldwin, was surprised and massacred in Macedonia,
by the orders of Theodore Comnenus, prince of
Epirus. A short time afterwards, the empress, who had
arrived at Constantinople by sea, died of grief, on learning
the tragical end of her husband. Robert of Courtenay,
second son of Peter, only ascended the throne to experience
the rapid decline of the empire; conquered in a great battle
by Vataces, the successor of Lascaris, he lost all the provinces
situated beyond the Bosphorus and the Hellespont;
whilst, on the other side, the prince of Epirus took possession
of Thessaly and a great part of Thrace. Constantinople,
threatened by formidable enemies, beheld from its towers
the standards of the Greeks of Nice and of the barbarians
of Mount Hemus, floating near its walls and insulting its
majesty. Amidst these various disasters, Robert died, leaving,
as his only successor, his brother Baldwin, still in his
childhood. John of Brienne, whom fortune had made, for
a short period, king of Jerusalem, was called to the tottering
throne of Constantinople, at the moment that the
Greeks and Bulgarians, animated by the ardour of pillage,
were at the gates of the capital. Their fleets penetrated to
the port, their numerous battalions were preparing to scale
the ramparts; but the new emperor fought several battles
with them, obtained possession of their ships, and dispersed
their armies. The miraculous victories of John of Brienne
added greatly to his renown, but only served to diminish his
forces: after having defeated his enemies, he found himself
without an army; and whilst the poets were comparing him
to Hector, Roland, and Judas Machabæus,<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> he was obliged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
to wait in his capital for succours that had been promised
him, and which never arrived. More than eighty years of
age, he terminated his active career in contesting with the
barbarians the remains of a power which had been founded
by arms, and the miserable wreck of which could only be
preserved by prodigies of valour.</p>

<p>The ruins which surrounded him in his last moments
must have made him sensible of the nothingness of human
grandeur, and produced sentiments of Christian humility.
He had passed the early days of his life amidst the austerities
of the cloister. On his death-bed he laid aside the
imperial purple, and was desirous of breathing his last sigh
in the habit of a Cordelier. A simple French knight, seated
for some few days upon two thrones, both ready to pass
away, son-in-law of two kings,<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> father-in-law of two emperors,
John of Brienne only left, when dying, the remembrance
of his extraordinary exploits, and the example of a
wonderful destiny. Young Baldwin, who had married his
daughter, and who was to have succeeded him, was unable
to obtain his inheritance; and departing as a fugitive from
his capital, he wandered through Europe as a suppliant,
braving and enduring the contempt of princes and nations.
Spectacle worthy of pity! the successor of the Cæsars,
clothed in the purple, was beheld imploring the charity of
the faithful, begging for the assistance granted to the lowest
indigence, and frequently not obtaining that for which he
sued.</p>

<p>Whilst the emperor of the East was thus travelling
through Italy, France, and England, Constantinople was
left without an army, and sacrificed for the defence of the
state, even to its relics, the objects of the veneration of the
people, and the last treasures of the empire. The sovereign
pontiff was touched with the misery and degradation of
Baldwin, and, at the same time, could not hear without pity
the complaints of the Latin church of Byzantium: he published
a new crusade for the defence of the empire of the
East.</p>

<p>The Crusaders, who were about to set out for the Holy
Land, were invited to lend their assistance to their brethren<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
of Constantinople; but the prayers and exhortations of the
Holy See produced but very feeble effects; opinions were
divided; some wished to defend the empire of the Latins,
others, the kingdom of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The French princes and nobles, however, persisted in
their resolution of going to fight against the Saracens in
Asia. The barons and knights either pawned or sold their
lands to purchase horses and arms, quitted their donjons
and their castles, and tore themselves from the embraces of
their wives. Thibault, their leader and interpreter, bade
adieu to France in verses which are still extant, and which
express, at the same time, the devotion of a Christian and
the spirit of chivalry. His muse, at once pious and profane,
deplores the torments of love, the griefs of absence, and
celebrates the glory of the soldiers of Christ; to console
himself for having left the lady of his thoughts, the king of
Navarre invokes the Virgin Mary, <i>the lady of the heavens</i>,
and finishes his complaints, by this verse, which so admirably
paints the manners of the time:</p>

<p>
Quand dame perds, Dame me soit aidant.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a><br />
</p>

<p>Other troubadours, after the example of the king of
Navarre, sang the departure of the pilgrims; they promised,
in their verses, the indulgences of the crusade to the warriors
that would set out for Syria, advising the dames and
demoiselles not to listen to those that should be left in
Europe; for, said they, there will remain none but cowards:
all the brave are going to seek glory in the battles of the
East. Whilst France was repeating the songs of the troubadours,
and prayers were offered up to Heaven in the
churches for the success of the expeditions, the Crusaders
from all the provinces of the kingdom commenced their
march, directing their course towards the port of Marseilles,
where vessels waited, to transport them into Asia; all were
animated by the most ardent zeal for the deliverance of the
holy places; but the pope, at whose voice they had taken
up arms, no longer applauded their enthusiasm. Gregory,
who had made himself a great many formidable enemies in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
West, appeared to have forgotten a war he had so warmly
promoted, and was entirely engrossed by his own dangers.</p>

<p>Most of the leaders of the crusade were assembled at
Lyons to deliberate upon the best means of carrying on their
enterprise, when they received a nuncio from the sovereign
pontiff, who commanded them to return to their homes.
This unexpected order from Gregory IX. gave great offence
to the princes and barons, who told the envoy of the court
of Rome, that the pope might change his policy, and disapprove
of that which he himself had set on foot; but that the
defenders of the cross, they who had devoted themselves to
the service of Christ, would remain steadfast in their intentions.
“We have made,” added they, “all our preparations;
we have pledged or sold our lands, our houses, and our goods;
we have quitted our friends and our families, giving out our
departure for Palestine: religion and honour forbid us to
retrace our steps.”<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<p>As the pope’s nuncio wished to speak and uphold the
authority of the Church, and as he accused the barons of
betraying the cause they were going to defend, the Christian
warriors could not restrain their indignation; the
soldiers and leaders were so exasperated, that they even
ill-treated the ambassador of the pontiff; and, but for the
intercession and prayers of the prelates and bishops, would
have immolated him to their anger.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the Crusaders dismissed the pope’s nuncio
with contempt, than deputies arrived from the emperor of
Germany, equally supplicating them to suspend their march,
and wait till he had collected his troops, in order to place
himself at their head. The knights and barons, animated
by a sincere zeal for the objects of their expedition, could
not comprehend the meaning of the delays thus attempted
to be thrown in the way of it, and sighed over the blindness
of the powers that wished to turn them aside from the road
to salvation. The king of Navarre, the dukes of Brittany
and Burgundy, with most of the nobles that had taken the
cross, persisted in the design of accomplishing their vow,
and embarked for Syria at the port of Marseilles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>A new misunderstanding had broken out between the
pope and Frederick, who were disputing the sovereignty of
Sardinia; all the passions were soon engaged in this quarrel,
and armed themselves, by turns, with the vengeance of
Heaven and the furies of war. Gregory, after having excommunicated
Frederick afresh, was determined to attack
his reputation, and degrade him in the opinion of his contemporaries.
Monitories and briefs from the pope were
read in all the churches of Europe, in which the emperor
was represented as an impious man, an accomplice of heretics
and Saracens, an oppressor of religion and humanity.
Frederick replied to the accusations of the sovereign pontiff
by the most violent invectives; he addressed himself to the
Romans, to excite them against the Holy See, and called
upon all the princes of Europe to defend his cause as their
own.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> “Kings and princes of the earth,” said he, “look
upon the injury done to us as your own, <i>bring water to extinguish
the fire that has been kindled in our neighbourhood</i>;
a similar danger threatens you.” The irritated pope hurled
all the thunders of the Church against his adversary; and
even went so far as to preach a crusade against the emperor,
saying, “There was more merit in combating a prince who
was rebellious to the successors of St. Peter, than in delivering
Jerusalem.” Throughout this scandalous contest,
the Church was allowed to possess nothing that was sacred,
the authority of princes nothing that was legitimate; on
one side, the sovereign pontiff considered all who remained
faithful subjects to the emperor as the ministers and accomplices
of the demon; on the other, the emperor would not
acknowledge the pope as the vicar of Christ. At last,
Gregory promised the imperial crown to any Christian
prince who would take up arms against the emperor, and
drag him from his throne: Louis IX., more wise than the
Church itself, refused the empire which was offered to him
for his brother Robert, and employed earnest but vain endeavours
to restore peace to Europe, disturbed by the pretensions
and menaces of the pope.</p>

<p>They soon came to hostilities; and Frederick, after having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
gained a great victory over the Milanese, and carried terror
amongst all the republics of Lombardy, marched towards
Rome at the head of an army. Gregory, who had no troops
at all, went through the streets of his capital at the head of
a procession; he exhibited to the Romans the relics of the
apostles, and, melting into tears, told them he had no means
of defending this sacred deposit without their assistance.
The nobility and people, touched by the prayers of the pope,
swore to die in defence of the Holy See. They set about
preparations for war, they fortified the city with the greatest
expedition; and when the emperor drew near to the gates,
he saw those same Romans, who, a short time before, had
embraced his cause against the pope, drawn up in battle-array
on the ramparts, determined to die in the cause of the
head of the Church. Frederick besieged the city, without
being able to get possession of it; in his anger, he accused
the Romans of perfidy, and revenged himself by exercising
horrible cruelties on his prisoners. The hatred enkindled
between the pope and the emperor soon passed into the
minds of the people, and the furies of civil war devastated
the whole of Italy.</p>

<p>Amidst such general disorder and agitation, the cries and
prayers of the Christians of Palestine were scarcely audible.
At the expiration of the truce concluded with Frederick,
the sultan of Damascus re-entered Jerusalem, and destroyed
the tower of David and the weak ramparts erected by the
Christians: this conquest, which revived the courage of the
Mussulmans, necessarily produced more than proportionate
despair among the unfortunate inhabitants of the Holy Land.
Instead of receiving within its walls the innumerable armies
that fame had announced, Ptolemaïs only had to welcome
the arrival of a few unarmed pilgrims, who had nothing to
relate but the deplorable quarrels of Christian monarchs
and princes. Most of the communications with the East
were closed; all the maritime powers of Italy were contending
for the empire of the sea; sometimes in league with the
sovereign pontiff, sometimes with the emperor. Several of
the Crusaders who had sworn to go to Constantinople or
Ptolemaïs, took part in the crusade that had been preached
against Frederick; others resolved to proceed to Syria by
land, and almost all perished in the mountains and deserts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
of Asia Minor; the French lords and princes, who, in spite
of the orders of the pope, set out for Asia from the ports
of Provence, were able to bring with them into Palestine
but a very small number of warriors.</p>

<p>At the period of the arrival of these Crusaders, the East
was not less troubled than the West. Melik-Kamel, the
sultan of Cairo, had recently died, and his death became the
signal for many sanguinary wars among the princes of his
family, who disputed by turns the kingdom of Egypt, and
the principalities of Damascus, Aleppo, and Hamah. Amidst
these divisions, the emirs and the Mamelukes, whose dangerous
support was constantly sought for, were accustomed
to dispose of power, and proved themselves more formidable
to their sovereigns than to the enemies of Islamism.
Supreme authority seemed to be the reward of victory or of
skill in treachery; the Mussulman thrones were environed
by so many perils, that a sultan of Damascus was seen
abandoning his sceptre, and seeking retirement, saying,
“a hawk and a hound afforded him more pleasure than
empire.” The princes, divided among themselves, called
for the succour of the Carismians and other barbarous
nations, who burnt their cities, pillaged their provinces, completed
the destruction of the powers they came to defend,
and perfected all the evils that were born of discord.</p>

<p>The Crusaders might have taken advantage of all these
troubles, but they never united their forces against the
enemy they had sworn to contend with; the kingdom of
Jerusalem had no government capable of directing the forces
of the crusade; the crowd of pilgrims had no tie, no common
point of interest which could hold them together for any
length of time under the same standards: scattered troops
of soldiers were to be seen, but there was nowhere an army;
each of the leaders and princes followed a plan of his own,
declared war or proclaimed peace in his own name, and
appeared to fight entirely for his own ambition or renown.</p>

<p>The duke of Brittany, followed by his knights, made an
incursion into the lands of Damascus, and returned to
Ptolemais with a rich booty; the other Crusaders, jealous
of the success of this expedition, were desirous of distinguishing
themselves by exploits, and formed the project of
attacking the city of Gaza. As they marched without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
order or precaution, they were surprised and cut to pieces
by the Saracens. The duke of Burgundy, who was at the
head of this expedition, escaped the pursuit of the conquerors
almost alone, and came back to Ptolemaïs, to deplore
the loss of his knights and barons, who had all met
with slavery or death on the field of battle. This reverse,
instead of uniting the Christians more closely, only increased
their discords; in the impossibility of effecting any triumph
for their arms, they treated separately with the infidels, and
made peace, as they had made war. The Templars and
some leaders of the army agreed for a truce with the sultan
of Damascus, and obtained the restitution of the holy
places; on their side, the Hospitallers, with the count of
Champagne, and the dukes of Burgundy and Brittany, concluded
a treaty with the sultan of Egypt, and undertook to
defend him against the Saracens who had just given up
Jerusalem to the Christians.</p>

<p>After having disturbed Palestine by their disorders, the
Crusaders abandoned it to return to Europe, and were replaced
at Ptolemaïs by some English, who arrived under
Richard of Cornwall, brother to Henry III. Richard, who
possessed the tin and lead mines of the county of Cornwall,
was one of the richest princes of the West: if old chronicles
are to be believed, Gregory had forbidden him to go to
the East, hoping that he would consent to remain in Europe,
and would impart a portion of his treasures to the Holy See,
to procure the indulgences of the crusade. When Richard
arrived before Ptolemaïs, he was received by the people and
the clergy, who went out to meet him, singing, “Blessed
be he who comes in the name of the Lord.” This prince
was the grandson of Richard Cœur de Lion,<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> whose courage
and exploits had rendered him so famous in the East. The
name alone of Richard spread terror among the Saracens;
the prince of Cornwall equalled his ancestor in bravery; he
was full of zeal and ardour, and his army shared his enthusiasm
for religion and glory. He prepared to open the
campaign, and everything seemed to promise success; but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
after a march of some days, and a few advantages obtained
over the enemy, finding himself very ill-seconded by the
Christians of Palestine, he was obliged to renew the truce
made with the sultan of Egypt. As the whole fruit of his
expedition, he could only obtain an exchange of prisoners,
and permission to pay the honours of sepulture to the
Christians killed at the battle of Gaza.</p>

<p>Without having seen either the walls of Jerusalem or the
banks of the Jordan, Richard embarked for Italy, where he
found the pope still engaged in the war against Frederick.
All Europe was in a blaze; a council convoked for the peace
of the Church had not been able to assemble; the emperor
still besieged the city of Rome, and threatened the head of
Christendom. Amidst this general disorder, Gregory died,
cursing his implacable adversary, and was succeeded by
Celestine IV., who only wore the tiara sixteen days. The
war was continued with renewed fury, the Church remained
without a head, and Christ without a vicar upon
earth; the cardinals wandered about dispersed; Frederick
holding several of them in chains. “The court of Rome,”
says Fleury, “was desolate, and fallen into great contempt.”
This deplorable anarchy lasted nearly two years; all Christendom
was loud in complaints, and demanded of Heaven a
pope able to repair the evils of Europe and the Church.</p>

<p>The conclave met at length, but the election of Innocent
IV., made amidst trouble and discord, put an end to
neither the public scandal nor the furies of the war, which
grieved all true Christians. The new pontiff followed the
example of Innocent III. and Gregory IX., and soon surpassed
all their excesses. Under his pontificate, disorder
continued increasing, until it had reached its height. The
Christians of Greece and Palestine were quite forgotten. Missionaries
in vain perambulated the kingdoms of the West,
to exhort the faithful to make peace among themselves, and
turn their arms against the Saracens; many of these angels
of peace were proscribed by Frederick, who was, at once, at
war with the sovereign pontiff, the emperor of the East, and
all those who, in taking the cross, had sworn to defend
Rome, or to deliver Constantinople or Jerusalem. We will
not attempt to describe the violent scenes of which the West,
but particularly Italy, was the theatre. Attention becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
fatigued by dwelling long upon the same pictures; the wars
and revolutions which lend so much life to history finish by
presenting only a wearisome, twice-told tale; and thus, likewise,
may the reader perceive that the passions have their
uniformity and tempests their monotony.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Each of the preceding crusades had a distinct object, a
march which could be easily followed, and was only remarkable
for great exploits or great reverses. That which we
have just described, which embraces a period of thirty years,
is mingled with so many different events, with so many
clashing interests, so many passions foreign to the holy
wars, that it at first appears to present only a confused picture;
and the historian, constantly occupied in relating the
revolutions of the East and of the West, may with reason
be accused of having, as a European Christian, forgotten
Jerusalem and the cause of Christ.</p>

<p>When we have read the twelfth book of this history, we
perceive that we are already far from the age that gave birth
to the crusades, and witnessed their brilliant progress. When
comparing this war with those that preceded it, it is easy to
see that it has a different character, not only in the manner
in which it was conducted, but in the means employed to
inflame the zeal of the Christians, and induce them to take
up arms.</p>

<p>When we observe the incredible efforts of the popes to
arm the nations of the West, we are at first astonished at
the small quantity of success obtained by their exhortations,
their menaces, and their prayers. We have but to compare
the Council of Clermont, held by Urban, with the Council of
the Lateran, presided over by Gregory. In the first, the
complaints of Jerusalem excite the tears and sobs of the
auditory; in the second, a thousand different objects intrude,
to occupy the attention of the fathers of the Church, who
express themselves upon the misfortunes of the Holy Land,
without emotion and without pain. At the voice of Urban,
knights, barons, and ecclesiastics all swore together to go
and fight against the infidels; the council became, in a
moment, an assembled host of intrepid warriors: it was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
so at the Council of the Lateran, in which no one took the
cross, or burst forth into an expression of that high enthusiasm
which the pope desired to awaken in all hearts.</p>

<p>We have drawn attention, in the course of our recital, to
the circumstance of pilgrims being permitted by the preachers
of the holy war to buy off their vow by paying a sum of
money; this mode of expiating sins appeared to be a scandalous
innovation: and the indulgence of the missionaries of
the holy war, who thus released the faithful from the pilgrimage,
made them lose a considerable portion of their
ascendancy. They were not, as formerly, the messengers of
Heaven; the multitude no longer endowed them with the
power of working miracles; they were even sometimes
obliged to employ the menaces and promises of the Church
to draw hearers to their sermons; in short, at length the
people ceased to consider them as the interpreters of the
gospel, and saw in them only the collectors of the dues of
the Holy See. This sale of the privileges of the crusade,
purchased at an extravagant price, necessarily checked the
effects of all generous passions, and, in the minds of Christians,
confounded that which belonged to Heaven with that
which belonged to earth.</p>

<p>Preceding ages were unacquainted with any other motive
but religion and its promises.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> The companions of Peter
the Hermit and Godfrey, the warriors who followed Louis
the Young, Philip Augustus, Richard Cœur de Lion, Boniface,
and Baldwin of Flanders, could not have possibly believed
that gold could be made a substitute for the merit
and glory of the holy war.</p>

<p>We find another remarkable difference in the preaching of
this crusade,&mdash;the refusal to admit great criminals under the
banners of the cross. The astonishment which the enrolment
of a crowd of obscure persons in the holy militia
caused among the Christian knights, suffices to denote a
great change in the manners and opinions of the Crusaders.
The sentiment of honour, which is allied with a love of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
glory, and has a tendency to establish distinctions among
men, appears to have prevailed over the purely religious
feeling which inspires humility, acknowledges the equal
rights of all Christians, and confounds repentance with
virtue. The crusade, into which none were admitted but
men of acknowledged bravery and good conduct, ceased, in
some sort, to be a simply religious war, and began to resemble
other wars, in which leaders have the power of
selecting the soldiers they have to command.</p>

<p>The enthusiasm for the holy wars only revived at intervals,
like a fire upon the point of going out of itself; the people
required some great event, some extraordinary circumstance,
some striking example of princes or warriors, to induce
them to take arms against the infidels; the subtleties of
theologians, who insisted upon everything being subservient
to their discussions, contributed to cool the remains of that
pious and warlike ardour, which, till that time, it had been
found necessary to moderate and restrain within just limits.
Disputes were started in the schools upon such questions as
these: In what case was a Christian exempt from the accomplishment
of his vow? What sum was sufficient to redeem
a promise made to Christ? If certain pious exercises could
be substituted for pilgrimage? If an heir was bound to
fulfil the oath of a testator? Whether the pilgrim who died
on his way to the Holy Land, had more merit in the eyes of
God than one who died on his return?<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> Whether a wife
could take the cross without the consent of her husband, or
the husband without the consent of the wife? &amp;c. From
the moment in which all these questions were solemnly discussed,
and, upon several points, the opinions of theologians
differed, enthusiasm, which never reasons, was rendered
languid by the cold arguments of the doctors; and pilgrims
appeared to yield less to the transports of a generous feeling,
than to the necessity of performing a duty or of following
an established rule.</p>

<p>This sixth crusade was more abundant in intrigues and
scandalous quarrels than in military exploits; the Christians
never united all their efforts against the infidels; no spirit
of order presided over their enterprises; the Crusaders, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
only held their mission of their zeal, set out at the time
their will or their fancy selected; some returned to Europe
without having faced a Saracen in fight; others abandoned
the colours of the cross, after a victory or a defeat; and fresh
Crusaders were constantly summoned to defend the conquests
or repair the faults of those that had preceded them.
Although the West had counted in this crusade more than
five hundred thousand of her warriors departing for Palestine
or Egypt, great armies were rarely assembled on the banks
of the Nile or the Jordan. As the Crusaders were never
gathered together in great bodies, they were not subjected
to famine, or the other scourges that had so fearfully thinned
the ranks of the early defenders of the cross; but if they
experienced fewer reverses, if they were better disciplined,
we may say that they showed none of that ardour, or of
those lively passions which men communicate to each other,
and which acquire a new degree of force and activity amidst
a multitude assembled for the same cause and under the
same banners.</p>

<p>By transferring the theatre of the war to Egypt, the Christians
no longer had before their eyes, as in Palestine, the
revered places and monuments, which could recall to them
the religion and the God they were about to fight for; they
had no longer before them and around them the river Jordan,
Libanus, Thabor, or Mount Sion, the aspect of which had
so vividly affected the imagination of the first Crusaders.</p>

<p>When the people of Europe heard the head of the Church
exhort the faithful to the conquest of Jerusalem, and at the
same time curse Frederick, the liberator of the holy city,
the object of the crusade lost its sacred character in the
eyes of Christians. The emperor of Germany, after his
return from his expedition, sometimes said, “If God had
been acquainted with the kingdom of Naples, he never could
have preferred the barren rocks of Jerusalem to it.” These
sacrilegious words of Frederick must have been a great subject
of offence to pilgrims; but, indeed, this prince only sent
to the Holy Land such of his subjects as he was dissatisfied
with, or wished to punish. The popes also condemned to
pilgrimage the great criminals whom society rejected from
its bosom, which was very repugnant to the manners and
opinions of the nobles and knights of Europe. As a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
crowning misfortune, the reverses or exploits of the Crusaders
beyond the seas frequently created divisions among the
princes of the West. From that time, Palestine was no
longer, in the eyes of the faithful, a land of blessedness,
flowing with milk and honey, but a place of exile. From
that time Jerusalem was less considered the city of God and
the heritage of Christ, than a subject of discord, or the
place in which were born all the storms that disturbed
Christendom.</p>

<p>In the other crusades, the popes had been satisfied with
awakening the enthusiasm of pilgrims, and addressing prayers
to Heaven for the success of the Crusaders; but in this war,
the heads of the Church insisted upon directing all the expeditions,
and commanding, by their legates, the operations
of the Christian armies. The invasion of Egypt was decided
upon in the Council of the Lateran, without a thought
of asking the advice or opinions of any of the skilful captains
of the age. When hostilities began, the envoys of the
pope presided over all the events of the war; weakening the
ardour of the soldiers of the cross, by their ambitious pretensions,
as well as by their ignorance. They let all the
fruits of victory slip through their hands, and gave birth to
an injurious rivalry between the spiritual and the temporal
powers. This rivalry, this reciprocal mistrust, were carried
so far, that the sovereign pontiff and the emperor of Germany,
by turns, arrested the march of the pilgrims; the first
fearing that the Crusaders, on embarking for Palestine,
would become the soldiers of Frederick; the second, that
these same soldiers might become the defenders of the
temporal power of the popes.</p>

<p>At the period of which we have just retraced the history,
so many crusades were preached at once, that the eyes of
the faithful were necessarily diverted from the first object of
these holy expeditions. Called upon to defend so many
causes, no one could distinguish which was the cause of God
and Jesus Christ; so many interests presented themselves
at the same time to the attention of Christians, and were
recommended to the bravery of warriors, that they gave
birth to hesitation and reflection; and these produced indifference.
Europe, for a length of time in a state of fermentation,
was undergoing the vague uncertainty of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
change; states began to think more of their independence,
people of their liberty. The passions which politics bring
forth, took the place of passions of which religion is the
motive.</p>

<p>The sanguinary quarrels of the emperor and the popes
contributed greatly to the revolution which was brought
about in men’s minds: the motive which animated the heads
of the Church was not always a religious one; the emperor
of Germany and the pontiffs of Rome had pretensions to
the domination of Italy, and had been, for a long time,
engaged in a rivalry of ambition. Gregory could not see
Frederick master of the kingdom of Naples without great
pain; and when he pressed him to go into Asia, to make
war upon the Saracens, he might have been compared to
that personage of ancient fable, who, in order to get rid of
his rival, sent him to combat the Chimera.</p>

<p>Four popes, although of a different character, finding
themselves in the same circumstances, pursued the same
policy. Frederick, by his cruelties, injustice, and extravagant
ambition, often justified the violences of the Holy See,
of which he was, by turns, the ward, the protector, and the
enemy; like his predecessors, he made no secret of his project
of restoring the empire of the Cæsars; and, had it not
been for the popes, it is not improbable that Europe would
have been brought under the yoke of the emperors of Germany.</p>

<p>The policy of the sovereign pontiffs, whilst weakening the
imperial power, favoured, in Germany, the liberty of cities,
and the growth and duration of small states; we do not
hesitate to add, that the thunders of the Church preserved
the independence of Italy, and perhaps that of France,
which was less ill treated by the court of Rome than neighbouring
nations. The French monarchy took advantage of
the troubles that existed on the other side of the Rhine, and
of the interdict set upon England, to repel the invasions of
the English and Germans; and, at the same time, availed
itself of the absence of the king of Navarre, the dukes of
Brittany and Burgundy, with several other great vassals,
whom the crusade attracted beyond the seas, to increase the
prerogatives of the royal authority, and extend the limits of
the kingdom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>England herself owes something to the authority of the
popes, who, by overwhelming John Lackland with excommunications,
rendered him powerless in his attempts to
enslave the English people, or to resist the demands of the
barons and the commons. This is a truth which impartial
history cannot deny or doubt, and which disposes us not to
approve, but to blame with less bitterness, excesses and
abuses of power of which all the effects have not been deplorable.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>
The populace of London, who burn every year
the effigy of the pope, would be much astonished if, amidst
a fanatical delirium, they were told that the army which
once fought for the independence of Great Britain was
called <i>the army of God and of the Holy Church</i>; if they
were reminded that the great charter of the Forest, the first
monument of British liberty, was the fortunate fruit of the
menaces and thunders of the Church of Rome, and that this
charter would never have been granted by John, without
the redoubtable influence and the imperious counsels of the
sovereign pontiff.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p>Without wishing to justify the domination of the popes,
we may say that they were led to grasp at supreme power
by the circumstances in which Europe was placed in the
eleventh and twelfth centuries. European society, without
experience or laws, and plunged in ignorance and anarchy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
cast itself into the arms of the popes, and believed that it
placed itself under the protection of Heaven.</p>

<p>As nations had no other ideas of civilization than such as
they received from the Christian religion, the sovereign pontiffs
naturally became the supreme arbiters between rival or
neighbouring countries; amidst the darkness which the light
of the Gospel had a continued and never-ending tendency to
diminish, their authority must naturally have been the first
established and the first recognised; temporal power stood
in need of their sanction; people and kings implored their
support and consulted their wisdom: they believed themselves
authorized to exercise a sovereign dictatorship.</p>

<p>This dictatorship was often exercised to the advantage of
public morality and social order; it often protected the weak
against the strong; it arrested the execution of criminal
plots; it re-established peace between states; and it preserved
a young society from the excesses of ambition, licentiousness,
and barbarism. When we cast our eyes over
the annals of the middle ages, we cannot help being struck
by one of the most beautiful spectacles that human society
has ever presented,&mdash;it is that of Christian Europe recognising
but one religion, having but one law, forming as it
were but one empire, governed by a single head, who spoke
in the name of God, and whose mission was to make the
Gospel reign upon earth.</p>

<p>In the general reflections by which we shall terminate this
work, we will enter into much greater developments upon
this head; we will compare modern Europe with the Europe
of the middle ages, and we will make it clear that, if we have
acquired some wisdom in the art of civilization, we are still
far from having turned it to the advantage of public liberty:
nations are at the present day led away by the spirit of the
French revolution, as they were in the middle ages by the
spirit of the court of Rome and enthusiasm for the crusades.
The French revolution began by liberal ideas, it was continued
by victories. The military spirit allied itself with the
fanaticism of new ideas, as it formerly allied itself with religious
enthusiasm. On casting a glance over our Europe,
we are astonished at seeing two contradictory things, which
should naturally exclude each other; we see almost everywhere
a tendency to favour the propagation of liberal ideas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
and at the same time an inclination to increase the mass of
armies; it is difficult to explain a policy which tends, on the
one side, to multiply the apostles of liberty, on the other to
multiply soldiers; which, by turns, proclaims a principle, and
raises a regiment; which speaks, at the same time, of recruiting,
and of a constitution; which appears never to have
laws enough, and yet is insatiable of cannons and bayonets.
It is easy to foresee the near and distant results of such a
monstrous amalgamation.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> Everything leads us to believe
that these results, like those of the crusades and the influence
of the pope in the middle ages, will not turn out <i>entirely</i> for
the advantage of civilization.</p>

<p>But without dwelling longer on these distressing reflections,
we will return to our subject, from which, perhaps,
we have strayed too long. In the eleventh and twelfth
centuries, the nations of Europe, subject to the authority
of St. Peter, were united together by a tie more strong than
that of liberty. This motive, this tie, which was that of
the universal Church, for a length of time kept up and
favoured the enthusiasm for and the progress of holy wars.
Whatever may have been the origin of the crusades, it is
certain they never would have been undertaken without that
unity of religious feelings which doubled the strength of the
Christian republic. The Christian nations, by the agreement
of their sentiments and their passions, showed the
world all that can be done by enthusiasm, which increases
by communication, and that lively faith, which, spread
among men, is a miraculous power, since the Gospel accords
it the faculty of <i>moving mountains</i>. In proportion as people,
united by one same spirit, separated, and ceased to make
one common cause, it became more difficult to collect together
the forces of the West, and pursue those gigantic
enterprises of which our age can scarcely perceive the
possibility.</p>

<p>It may have been observed, that the pontifical authority
and the enthusiasm for the crusades experienced the same
vicissitudes; the opinions and the exaltation of the religious
spirit which caused men to take up arms, necessarily, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
same time, increased the influence of the sovereign pontiffs.
But springs so active and so powerful could not possibly
last long; they broke by the violence with which they were
employed.</p>

<p>The popes, invested with authority without limit, exercised
that authority without moderation; and as the abuse
of power brings on, sooner or later, its own ruin, the empire
of the sovereign pontiffs finished by declining as other empires
have done. Their fall commenced with their long contests
with Frederick; all Europe was called upon to judge
their cause; their power, founded upon opinion, the origin
of which was entirely religious, lost much of its prestige by
being given over to the discussions of men of the world.</p>

<p>At the same time that the sovereign pontiffs abused their
power, the spirit and enthusiasm that had produced the holy
wars were likewise abused. Many Christian princes took
the cross, sometimes to obtain the protection of the popes;
sometimes as a pretext for assembling armies, and enjoying
the temporal advantages accorded to the soldiers of Christ.
The leaders of Christendom, without having originated the
wars of the East, were eager to profit by them; in the first
place, to extend their dominions, and in the next to gratify
violent passions. From that moment society sought other
supports than that of the Holy See, and warriors another
glory than that of the crusades.</p>

<p>Thibault, king of Navarre, who, in his verses, had preached
the war beyond the seas, was disgusted at the troubles excited
in Europe by the heads of the Church, and deplored
with bitterness <i>a time full of felony, envy, and treachery</i>.
He accused the princes and barons of being without <i>courtoisie</i>,
and reproached the popes with excommunicating
those who were most in the right (<i>ceux qui avaient le plus
raison</i>). If a few troubadours still raised their voices to
exhort Christians to take up the cross and arms, the greater
part did not partake of their enthusiasm for the holy wars;
and beheld nothing in these pilgrimages beyond the seas,
but the griefs of a long absence, and the rigours of a pious
exile.</p>

<p>In a Tenson<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> which has come down to us, Folquet de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
Romans asks Blaccas, the model of troubadours and of
knights, whether he will go to the Holy Land? After
having answered that he loves and is beloved, and that he
will remain at home with his ladye-love, (she was countess
of Provence), Blaccas thus ends his simple song:&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppq8 p1">“Je ferai ma pénitence,<br />
Entre mer et Durance,<br />
Auprès de son manoir.”<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

<p class="ppq6 p1">“I will perform my penitence<br />
Between the sea and swift Durance,<br />
Near to my lady’s bower.”</p>

<p class="p1">These sentiments belonged to the manners of troubadours
and knights; but at the time of the first crusades,
religious ideas were much more mixed up with ideas of
gallantry; a poet, invited to take the cross, would not have
dared to speak of his ladye-love,<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> without likewise speaking
of the mercy of God and the captivity of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>During the other crusades, the religion and morality of
the Gospel resumed their empire, and spread their benefits
everywhere; at the voice of the holy orators, Christians
became penitent and reformed their morals; all political
tempests were laid by the simple name of Jerusalem, and
the West remained in profound peace.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> It was not so at
the period we have just described; Europe was perhaps
never more agitated, or, perhaps, more corrupted than
during the thirty years which this crusade lasted.</p>

<p>In the relations between the Christians and Mussulmans,
little respect had, to this time, certainly, been paid to
treaties; but in this crusade, contempt for sworn faith and
forgetfulness for the laws of nations were carried to an extreme:
signing a truce was a preparation for war;&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
Christian armies owed their safety to a treaty of peace; and
the sovereign pontiff, far from respecting the conditions of
it, preached a new crusade against the infidels. It must be
allowed, also, that the most solemn treaties were often
violated by the Mussulmans. The duration of peace depended
solely upon the want of power in both parties to
resume hostilities with advantage. The least hope of success
was sufficient to induce them to fly to arms; the slightest
circumstance was an excuse for rekindling all the flames of
war. The continuator of William of Tyre says, with great
ingenuousness, when speaking of the death of a sultan of
Damascus: “When the sultan died, all the truces died
with him.” These words alone are sufficient to give an idea
of the state of the East during the sixth crusade, and of
the small degree of respect then entertained for the laws of
peace and war.</p>

<p>If, in the preceding crusade, the expedition of the soldiers
of the cross against Greece did not produce great advantages
to the West, it at least illustrated the arms of the
Venetians and the French. In the war we have just described,
the knights and barons who took the cross, added
nothing to their glory or their renown. The Crusaders who
were fortunate enough to revisit their homes, brought back
with them nothing but the remembrance of most shameful
disorders. A great number of them had nothing to
show their compatriots but the chains of their captivity;
nothing to communicate but the contagious disorders of the
East.</p>

<p>The historians we have followed are silent as to the ravages
of the leprosy among the nations of the West; but the
testament of Louis VIII., an historical monument of that
period, attests the existence of two thousand <i>léproseries</i>
(hospitals for lepers) in the kingdom of France alone. This
horrible sight must have been a subject of terror to the
most fervent Christians; and was sufficient to disenchant, in
their eyes, those regions of the East, where, till that time,
their imaginations had seen nothing but prodigies and
marvels.</p>

<p>Among the abuses then made of the spirit of the crusades,
and the misfortunes they brought in their train, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
must not forget the civil and religious wars of which France
and several other countries of Europe were the theatre. In
their expeditions into the East, Christians had become familiarized
with the idea of employing force and violence to
change men’s hearts and opinions. As they had long made
war against infidels, they were willing to make it, in the
same manner, against heretics; they first took up arms
against the Albigeois, then against the pagans of Prussia;
for the same reason, and in the same manner, that they had
armed themselves against the Mussulmans.</p>

<p>Modern writers have declaimed with great vehemence and
eloquence against these disastrous wars; but long before the
age in which we live, the Church had condemned the excesses
of blind fanaticism.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> Saint Augustine, St. Ambrose, the
fathers of councils, had long taught the Christian world that
error is not destroyed by the sword, and that the truths of
the Gospel ought not to be preached to mankind amidst
threats and violences.</p>

<p>The crusade against the Prussians shows us all that ambition,
avarice, and tyranny can exhibit that is most cruel
and barbarous; the tribunal of history cannot judge with
too much severity the leaders of this war, the ravages and
furies of which were prolonged during more than a century;
but, whilst condemning the excesses of the conquerors of
Prussia, we must admit the advantages Europe gained by
their victories and exploits. A nation that had been separated
from all other nations by its manners and customs,
ceased to be a foreigner in the Christian republic. Industry,
laws, religion, which marched in the train of the conquerors,
to moderate and remove the evils of war, spread their blessings
among hordes of savages. Many flourishing cities
arose from amidst the ashes of forests, and the oak of
Remove,<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> beneath the shade of which human victims had
been immolated, was replaced by churches, in which the virtues
and charity of the Gospel were inculcated. The conquests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
of the Romans were sometimes more unjust, then
wars more barbarous; they procured less advantages to the
civilized world, and yet they have never ceased to be objects
of the admiration and eulogy of posterity.</p>

<p>The war against the Albigeois was more cruel and more
unfortunate than the crusade directed against the nations of
Prussia. Missionaries and warriors outraged, by their conduct,
all the laws of justice and of the religion whose
triumph they pretended to aim at. The heretics, naturally,
sometimes employed reprisals against their enemies; both
sides armed with the steel and axe of murderers and
executioners, humanity had to deplore the most guilty
excesses.</p>

<p>When casting a retrospective glance over the annals of
the middle ages, we are particularly grieved to see sanguinary
wars undertaken and carried on in the name of a religion
of peace, whilst we can scarcely find an example of a
religious war among the ancients and under the laws of
paganism.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> We must believe that modern nations and
those of antiquity have, and had the same passions; but,
amongst the ancients, religion entered less deeply into the
heart of man or into the spirit of social institutions. The
worship of false gods had no positive dogma; it added nothing
to morality; it prescribed no duties to the citizen; it
was not bound up with the maxims of legislation, and existed,
in some sort, only upon the surface of society. When
paganism was attacked, or when a change was effected in
the worship of false gods, the affections, morals, and interests
of pagan society were not deeply wounded. It was not
thus with Christianity, which, particularly in the middle
ages, mixed itself up with all civil laws, recalled man to all
the duties due to his country, and united itself with all the
principles of social order. Amidst the growing civilization
of Europe, the Christian religion was blended with all the
interests of nations; it was, in a manner, the foundation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
all society; it was society itself: we cannot wonder, then,
that men were passionate in its defence. Then all who
separated themselves from the Christian religion, separated
themselves from society; and all who rejected the laws of the
Church, ceased to acknowledge the laws of their country.
We must consider the wars against the Albigeois and the
Prussians in this light; they were rather social wars than
religious wars.</p>

<p class="pc mid">SEVENTH CRUSADE.</p>

<p class="pc lmid">A.D. 1242-1245.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">When</span> I began this work, I was far from being aware of
the task I was imposing upon myself; animated by the interest
of my subject, full of a too great confidence in my
own powers, like those villagers who, when they set out for
the first crusade, fancied every city they saw to be Jerusalem,
I constantly believed I was approaching the end of my
labours. As I advanced in my career, the horizon expanded
before me, difficulties multiplied at every step, so that to
sustain my courage, I have often been obliged to recall to
my mind the kindness with which the early volumes of this
history have been received by the public.</p>

<p>The difficulty did not consist in placing a narrative of the
holy wars before our readers; it became necessary to present
exact ideas of the manners and characters of the nations
which, in any way, took part in them. We have endeavoured
to make all the peoples known who have in turn
passed across the scene: the Franks, with their soldier-like
roughness, their love of glory, and their generous passions;
the Turks and Saracens, with their military religion
and their barbarous valour; the Greeks, with their
corrupted manners, their character at once superstitious and
frivolous, and their vanity, which with them supplied the
place of patriotism: a new nation is now about to offer
itself to the pencil of history, and mingle with the events
of which we are attempting to give the picture. We are
about to say a few words upon the manners and conquests
of the Tartars in the middle ages.</p>

<p>The hordes of this nation, at the period of the sixth crusade,
had invaded several countries of Asia, and the progress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
of their arms had a great influence over the policy of the
Mussulman powers of Syria and Egypt, which were then at
war with the Christians. At the time of which we are
speaking, the fame of their victories filled the East, and
spread terror even to the most remote countries of Europe.</p>

<p>The Tartars inhabited the vast regions which lie between
ancient Emaüs, Siberia, China, and the Sea of Kamschatka;
they were divided into several nations, which all boasted of
having the same origin; each of these nations, governed by a
khan, or supreme leader, was composed of a great number of
tribes, each tribe commanded by a particular chief, called
Myrza. The produce of the chase, the milk of their mares,
and the flesh of their flocks, satisfied the simple wants of the
Tartars; they lived under tents with their families; and
moveable dwellings, drawn by oxen, transported from one
place to another their wives, their children, and all they
possessed. In summer, the whole tribe drew towards the
northern countries, and encamped upon the banks of a river
or a lake; in winter, they directed their course southward,
and sought the shelter of mountains that could protect them
from the icy winds of the north.</p>

<p>The Tartar hordes assembled every year, in either autumn
or spring. In these assemblies, which they called <i>Couraltaï</i>,
they deliberated on horseback, upon the march of the tribes,
the distribution of the pasturages, and peace and war. It
was from the bosom of this tumultuous assembly that issued
the legislation of the people of Tartary; a simple and laconic
legislation, like those of all barbarous nations, whose only
objects are to maintain the power of the leaders, and keep
up discipline and emulation among the warriors.</p>

<p>The nations of Tartary acknowledged one God, the sovereign
of heaven, to whom they offered up neither incense
nor prayers. Their worship was reserved for a crowd of
genii, whom they believed to be spread through the air,
upon the earth, and amidst the waters; a great number of
idols, the rough work of their own hands, filled their dwellings,
followed them in their courses, and watched over their
flocks, their slaves, and their families. Their priests, brought
up in the practices of magic, studied the course of the stars,
predicted future events, and employed themselves in abusing
the minds of the people by sorcery. Their religious worship,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
which inculcated no morality, had neither softened
their rude manners nor ameliorated their character, which
was as boisterous and unkindly as their climate. No monument
raised under the auspices of religion, no book inspired
by it, reminded them of deeds of glory, or laid before them
precepts and examples of virtue. In the course of their
wandering life, the dead, whom they sometimes dragged with
them in their waggons, appeared to them an annoying burden,
and they buried them in haste in retired places; where, covering
them with the sands of the desert, they were satisfied with
concealing them from the eyes or the outrages of the living.</p>

<p>Everything that might fix them to one spot rather than
another, or lead them to change their manner of living, excited
the animadversion and disdain of these races. Of all the
tribes that inhabited Mogul Tartary, one alone was acquainted
with writing, and cultivated letters; all the rest despised commerce,
arts, and learning; which constitute the true splendour
of polished societies. The Tartars disdained the idea
of building; in the twelfth century their vast country contained
but one city,<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> the extent of which, according to the
monk Rubruquis, did not equal that of the little town of
Saint Denis. Confining themselves to the care of their
flocks, they regarded agriculture as a degrading occupation,
only fit to employ the industry of slaves or conquered people.
Their immense plains had never become yellow with harvests
sown by the hand of man; no fruit had there ripened which
he had planted. The spectacle most agreeable to a Tartar
was the desert, upon which grass grew without cultivation
or the field of battle covered with ruin and carnage.</p>

<p>As the limits of their pastures were under no regulation,
frequent quarrels necessarily arose among the Tartars; the
spirit of jealousy constantly agitated the wandering hordes;
the ambitious leaders could endure neither neighbours nor
rivals. Thence civil wars; and from the bosom of civil wars
issued a fully-armed despotism, to support which the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
flocked with cheerfulness, because it promised them conquests.
The entire population was military, to whom fighting
appeared to be the only true glory, and the most noble
occupation of man. The encampments of the Tartars, their
marches, their hunting-parties, resembled military exhibitions.
Habit imparted so much ease and firmness to their
seat on horseback, that they took their food, and even indulged
in sleep, without dismounting. Their bow, of an
enormous size, announced their strength and skill; their
sharp steel-headed arrows flew to an immense distance, and
struck down the bird amidst its rapid career, or pierced
through and through the bear or tiger of the desert; they
surpassed their enemies in the rapidity of their evolutions;
they excelled them in the perfidious art of fighting whilst
flying; and retreat was often, for them, the signal of victory.
All the stratagems of war appeared familiar to them; and as
if a fatal instinct had taught them all that could assist in
the destruction of the human race, the Tartars, who built
no cities, knew how to construct the most formidable
machines of war, and were not unacquainted with any means
that could spread terror and desolation among their enemies.
In their expeditions, their march was never impeded by the
inclemency of seasons, the depth of rivers, the steepness of
precipices, or the height of mountains. A little hardened
milk, diluted with water, sufficed for the food of a horseman
during several days; the skin of a sheep or a bear, a few
strips of coarse felt, formed his garments. The warriors
showed the most blind obedience to their leaders, and, at
the least signal, were ready to encounter death in any shape.
They were divided into tens, hundreds, thousands, and tens
of thousands; their armies were composed of all that could
handle the bow or lance; and what must have caused their
enemies as much surprise as terror, was the order and discipline
that prevailed in a multitude that chance seemed to
have gathered together. According to their military legislation,
the Tartars were never allowed to make peace but
with a conquered enemy; he who fled from battle, or abandoned
his companions in danger, was punished with death;
they shed the blood of men with the same indifference as
that of wild animals, and their ferocity added greatly to the
terror which they inspired in their enterprises.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>The Tartars, in their pride, despised all other nations, and
believed that the whole world ought to be subject to them.
According to certain opinions, transmitted from age to age,
the Mogul hordes abandoned the north to the dead they left
behind them in the deserts, and kept their faces constantly
directed towards the south, which was promised to their
valour. The territories and the riches of other nations
excited their ambition; and, possessing neither territories
nor riches themselves, they had almost nothing to fear from
conquerors. Not only their warlike education, but their prejudices,
their customs, the inconstancy of their character,
everything with them seemed to favour distant expeditions
and warlike invasions. They carried with them neither
regrets nor endearing remembrances from the countries they
abandoned; and if it be true, when we say that country is
not within the walls of a city, or the limits of a province, but
in the affections and ties of family, in the laws, manners,
and customs of a nation, the Tartars, when changing their
climate, had always their country with them. The presence
of their wives, of their children; the sight of their flocks and
their idols, everywhere inflamed their patriotism, or love of
their nation, and sustained their courage. Accustomed to
consult their own inclinations, and take them for their sole
rule of conduct, they were never restrained by the laws of
morality or by feelings of humanity; as they had a profound
indifference for all the religions of the earth, this indifference
even, which aroused no hatred in other nations, facilitated
their conquests, by leaving them the liberty of readily receiving
or embracing the opinions and creeds of the people
they conquered, and whom they thus completely subjected
to their laws.</p>

<p>In very remote antiquity, the hordes of Tartary had
several times invaded the vast regions of India, China, and
Persia, and had extended their ravages even into the West:
the ambition or the caprice of a skilful leader, excess of
population, want of pasturage, the predictions of a wizard,
were quite sufficient to inflame this tumultuous race, and
precipitate them in a mass upon distant regions. Woe to
the people whom the Tartars encountered in their passage!
At their approach, empires fell with a horrible crash; nations
were driven back upon one another, like the waves of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
sea; the world was shaken and covered with ruins. History
has preserved the remembrance of several of their invasions;
the most remote posterity will never pronounce without a
species of terror the names of the Avari, the Huns, the
Heruli, of all those wandering nations who, some flowing
from the depths of Tartary, and others dragged in the wake
of the conquerors or driven before them, poured down upon
the tottering empire of the Romans, and divided the spoils
of the civilized world amongst them: in the middle ages,
the wars of the Tartars were compared to tempests, inundations,
or the bursting forth of volcanoes; and the resigned
nations believed that the justice of God held these innumerable
swarms of barbarians in reserve in the north, to pour
out his anger upon the rest of the earth, and chastise corrupted
nations by their hands.</p>

<p>The Tartars never proved themselves more redoubtable
than under the reign of Gengiskhan. Temugin, which was
the first name of the heroic barbarian, was born of a prince
who reigned over some hordes of ancient Mogulistan.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>
Traditions relate that the seventh of his ancestors was
engendered in the womb of his mother by the miraculous
influence of the rays of the sun. At the birth of Temugin,
his family remarked with joy some coagulated blood in the
hands of the infant, a sinister presage for the human race,
in which flattery or superstition saw the future glory of a
conqueror. Some historians inform us that nothing was
neglected in the education of Temugin; others, more worthy
of faith, affirm that he could not read; but all agree in
saying that he was born for war, and to command a warlike
people. Endowed with great penetration of mind, and with
a sort of eloquence, knowing how to dissemble in season,
skilful in working upon the passions, uniting bravery to a
boundless ambition, that was never checked by any scruple,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
he had all the qualities and all the vices which lead to empire
among barbarians, and sometimes even among polished
nations. His natural propensities developed themselves in
adversity, which hardened his character, and taught him to
brave everything in order to carry out his designs. From
the age of fourteen, despoiled of his paternal heritage, and
a fugitive with the khan of the Karaïtes, he sacrificed without
pain the most holy duties of hospitality to his future grandeur.
The khan of the Karaïtes was known by the name of
Prester John among the Christians of the middle ages,<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>
who celebrated his conversion to Christianity, and considered
him as one of the most fervent apostles of the Gospel,
which, doubtless, he never had known. He confided the
care of his states to young Temugin, who insinuated himself
into the favour of the army, and dethroned his benefactor.
As he had outraged all the laws of morality to usurp empire,
he violated all the laws of humanity to maintain himself in
it. Seventy of his enemies plunged into seventy caldrons
of boiling water, and the skull of the chief of the Karaïtes
enchased in a golden box, announced very plainly what the
master was whom fortune was about to place over the
nations of Asia.</p>

<p>Victory was to achieve what treachery, violence, and ingratitude
had begun; the arms of Temugin and his lieutenants
subdued successively all the hordes whose camps
arose between the wall of China and the Volga. Temugin
was the all-powerful leader of many millions of shepherds
and warriors, impatient to quit their own climate and invade
the regions of the south. In order to attach the companions
of his victories to his fortunes, he was desirous of reigning
by their suffrages, and called together a couraltaï or general
diet, in which he was proclaimed sovereign of the Moguls.
The ambition of Temugin did not neglect the influence of
superstition; he took the title of Gengis, <i>king of kings</i>, or
<i>master of the world</i>, and fame gave out that he had received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
this pompous title from a prophet who descended from
heaven upon a white horse.</p>

<p>Eastern historians have praised Gengiskhan for having
given laws to nations he had conquered. These laws, the
aim of which was to maintain the peace of families, and to
direct the minds of the people towards war, for a length of
time retained the obedience and the respect of the Moguls.
As Gengiskhan, in his legislation, acknowledged one God,
the sovereign of the earth and heaven, and, at the same
time, permitted all kinds of creeds, some modern writers
have taken occasion to boast of his religious tolerance. But
what could be the tolerance of a savage conqueror, who
caused himself to be styled the son of the sun, the son of
God; who himself followed no worship, and to whom all
religions were equally indifferent, provided they crossed
neither his ambition nor his pride?</p>

<p>The lieutenants and warriors of Gengiskhan had recognised
him with the greater joy, as universal conqueror and
master of the earth, from the hopes they entertained of enriching
themselves with the spoils of all the nations subdued
by his arms. His first enterprises were directed against
China, of which empire he had been the vassal. Neither
the barrier of the great wall, nor the ascendancy of knowledge
and arts, nor the use of gunpowder, said to be then
known among the Chinese, was able to defend a flourishing
empire against the attacks of a multitude, whom the thirst
for booty and a warlike instinct, urged forward to face perils,
and rendered invincible.</p>

<p>The wars we have seen in our days, and of which we deplore
the calamities, give nothing but a feeble idea of these
gigantic invasions, in which many millions of men perished
by sword and famine. China experienced twice all the evils
inseparable from a war which appeared to be directed by
the genius of destruction; and, in the space of a few
years, the most ancient and the most powerful kingdom of
Asia, covered with blood and ruins, and deprived of half its
population, became one of the provinces of the new empire
founded by the shepherds of Mogulistan.</p>

<p>The conquest of Carismia soon followed that of China;
Carismia was close to the frontiers of the Mogul empire,
and, on one side extended to the Gulf of Persia, and on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
other, to the limits of India and Turkistan. Gengis learnt
that a Tartar caravan and three of his ambassadors had been
massacred in one of the cities of the Carismians. It is easy
to imagine the effect that this news would produce upon the
emperor of the Moguls, who himself compared the anger
of kings to the fire of conflagrations, which the lightest
wind may light up.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> After having fasted and prayed, during
three days and three nights, upon a mountain, where a
hermit announced to him, the second time, the conquest of
the whole world, the terrible Gengiskhan commenced his
march, at the head of seven hundred thousand Tartars. This
army met that of the Carismians on the banks of the
Jaxartes; Mahomet, sultan of Carismia, who had several
times carried his victorious arms into Turkistan and Persia,
commanded the host of the Carismians. The plain in which
this battle was fought was covered by twelve hundred thousand
combatants; the shock was terrific, the carnage horrible;
victory was adverse to Mahomet, who, from that day,
together with his family and the whole of his nation, sunk
into the lowest abyss of misfortune.</p>

<p>The cities of Otrar, Bochara, Samarcand, Candahar, and
Carismia, besieged by an innumerable multitude, fell in turn
into the power of the conqueror, and witnessed the extirpation
of their garrisons and inhabitants. We cannot suppress
a feeling of pity when history presents to us, on one
side, an entire population flying from their devastated homes,
to seek an asylum in deserts and mountains; and on the
other, the family of a powerful monarch dragged into slavery
or groaning in exile; and this monarch himself, whose prosperity
all Asia had boasted or envied, abandoned by his subjects,
and dying with misery and despair in an island of the
Caspian Sea.</p>

<p>The army of Gengiskhan returned to Tartary, loaded with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
the spoils of Carismia: the sovereign of the Moguls<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> appeared
to form the desire of governing his conquests in
peace; but the world, agitated by his victories, and always
eager to throw off his yoke, together with the warlike spirit
of his nation, to whom he had afforded a glimpse of the
riches of other people, would not permit him again to enjoy
repose; he was on the point of undertaking a third expedition
against China, which seemed disposed to rebel, when
death put an end to his career. Some historians assert that
he was struck dead by thunder, as if Heaven had determined
itself to crush the instrument of its wrath;<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> others,
much more worthy of belief, inform us that the Tartar hero
died in his bed, surrounded by his children, to whom he recommended
to preserve union among themselves, that they
might achieve the conquest of the world. Octaï, the eldest
of his sons, succeeded him in the empire, and, according to
the custom of the Moguls, the great men assembled and
said to him, “We wish, we pray, we command you to accept
of entire power over us.” The new emperor answered
by this formula, which contains the whole spirit of the
despotic governments of the East: “If you desire that I
should be your khan, are you resolved to obey me in everything;
to come when I shall call you, to go where I shall
send you, and to put to death all those I shall command you
to kill?” After they had answered “Yes,” he said to
them, “Henceforth my simple word shall serve me as a
sword.” Such was the government of the Tartars. Octaï
was about to reign over an empire composed of several
great empires; his brothers and nephews commanded the
innumerable armies that had conquered China and Carismia;
they governed in his name in the north, in the south, and
the east, kingdoms of which the extent was scarcely known;
each of his lieutenants was more powerful than the greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
kings of the earth, and all obeyed him as his slaves. For
the first time, perhaps, concord was preserved among conquerors;
and this monstrous union effected the ruin of all
the nations of Asia: Turkistan, Persia, India, the southern
provinces of China, which had escaped the ravages of the
first invasion, all that remained of the empire of the Abassides
and of that of the Seljoucides&mdash;all fell before the arms
of the redoubtable posterity of Gengiskhan. Many of the
sovereigns whom, in these days of disorder and calamity the
chance of war hurled from their thrones, had invoked the
succour of the Moguls, and favoured the enterprises of that
warlike people against neighbouring or rival powers. Fortune
enveloped them all in the same ruin, and oriental history
compares them to the three dervises whose indiscreet
wishes and prayers reanimated, in the desert, the bones
of a lion, who sprang up from the bosom of the sand and
devoured them.</p>

<p>The conquest of the richest countries of Asia had inflamed
the enthusiasm of the Tartars to such a degree, that it would
have been impossible for their leaders to confine them within
the limits of their own territories, or bring them back to the
peaceful labours of pastoral life. Octaï, whether desirous
of obeying the paternal instructions, or whether he felt the
necessity of employing the restless and turbulent activity of
the Moguls, resolved to turn his arms towards the West.
Fifteen hundred thousand shepherds or warriors inscribed
their names upon the military register; five hundred thousand
of the most robust were selected for the great expedition;
the others were to remain in Asia, to maintain the
submission of the vanquished nations, and complete the
conquests commenced by Gengiskhan. Rejoicings, which
lasted forty days, preceded the departure of the Mogul
army, and were as a signal of the desolation they were about
to spread among the countries of Europe.</p>

<p>In their rapid course, the Tartars crossed the Volga, and
penetrated, almost without obstacle, into Muscovy, then a
prey to the fury of civil war. The devastation of their
country, the conflagrations of Kiow and Moscow, and the
disgraceful yoke that so long oppressed these northern
regions, were the punishments due to the feeble resistance
of the Muscovites. After the conquest of Russia, the multitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
of Moguls, led by Batou, son of Tuli, directed their
victorious course towards Poland and the frontiers of Germany,
and repeated, wherever they went, the horrors of
Attila and his Huns. The cities of Lublin and Warsaw
disappeared on their passage, and they laid waste both shores
of the Baltic. In vain the duke of Silesia, the Polish palatines,
and the grand master of the Teutonic order, united
their forces to arrest the progress of this new scourge of
God;<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> the generous defenders of Europe succumbed upon
the plains of Lignitz, and nine sacks, filled with human
ears, were the trophy of the victory of the barbarians. The
Carpathian mountains presented but a feeble barrier to
these invincible hordes; and the Tartars soon burst like a
fearful tempest over the territories of those Hungarians
who, two centuries before, had, like them, quitted the deserts
of Scythia, and conquered the fertile banks of the Danube.
Bela, king of Hungary, had recently attracted forty thousand
families of Comans into his dominions, who betrayed
him; the palatines and magnates of the kingdom were
divided among themselves, and not even the aspect of danger
could induce them to unite or submit themselves to the
laws of the monarch. Disobedience, treachery, and discord,
delivered the whole kingdom up to the furies of a pitiless
enemy; the flocks, the harvests, the entire wealth of the
country, became the prey of the Moguls; half the population
was exterminated. Of all the cities of Hungary, only
three offered an earnest and true resistance, and thus preserved
themselves from scenes of carnage and destruction.
The shepherds of Scythia, who could not read, have left to
the vanquished the task of describing their conquests, and
we have great difficulty in crediting the accounts of the old
Hungarian chronicles, when they describe the unheard-of
cruelties by which the Moguls disgraced their victories;<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>
but several provinces entirely depopulated and changed into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
deserts, the ruins of two thousand churches, fifty destroyed
cities, the traditions of these great disasters transmitted
from age to age, and the terror that pervaded Europe, are
evidences so worthy of faith, that we cannot reject them.</p>

<p>In the general consternation, it is surprising that the
Moguls did not direct their arms against the Latin empire of
Constantinople, then menaced by the Greeks, and little better
than a ruin; but the shepherds of the desert did not employ
themselves in inquiries concerning the interior revolutions
of states or of the signs of their decay; they preserved, as
did all the nations of Asia, a vague and confused idea of the
power of the armies of ancient Byzantium, but took little
heed whether the moment were come to attack it and conquer
it. The great advantages which the imperial city derived
from its position between Europe and Asia, did not at all
strike the Tartars, who were ignorant of both navigation
and commerce, and infinitely preferred rich pastures to the
sumptuous edifices of great capitals. Thus we may equally
believe, either that the city of Constantine was protected on
this occasion by the memories of its past greatness, or that
it owed its safety to the contempt and indifference of the
barbarians.</p>

<p>The Franks established in Syria enjoyed the same good
fortune as the Greeks of Byzantium. The armies of the
Moguls had not yet crossed the Euphrates.</p>

<p>Whilst the tumult of war and the fall of empires resounded
from the Yellow River to the Danube, the Christians
of Palestine, protected by the discords of the Saracens,
resumed possession of Jerusalem: they were beginning to
repair the walls of the holy city, and rebuild the churches;
and thanked Heaven in peace, for having preserved them
from the scourges that were devastating the rest of the
world. The Tartars were scarcely aware of the existence or
the name of a country for which so much blood had been
spilt, and were not likely to be attracted to the revered but
barren banks of the Jordan, by either the hopes of booty
or by the remembrances which excited the warlike enthusiasm
of the nations of the West. Happy would it have
been for the Christian colonies, if a people, conquered by
the Moguls, driven from their own territories, and seeking
an asylum everywhere, had not come to disturb their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
transient security, and plunge the city of Christ into fresh
calamities.</p>

<p>After the death of Mahomet, sultan of Carismia, his son
Gelaleddin gathered together an army. The valour which
he displayed in several battles astonished his enemies, and,
for a moment, brought back to his standard the sad remains
of his empire; fortune favoured his expeditions into Georgia
and India; but at last he forgot the lessons of adversity
amidst the intoxication of pleasures; he lost all his conquests,
and perished miserably among the Curds, where he
had sought refuge. The Carismian warriors, incessantly
pursued by the Tartars, abandoned a country they could no
longer defend, and, under the command of one of their
leaders named Barbakan, spread themselves through Asia
Minor and Syria.</p>

<p>These hordes, banished from their own country, marched,
sword and torch in hand, and, in their despair, seemed to
wish to avenge upon other nations the evils they had suffered
from the Tartars. History describes these furious
bands, wandering along the banks of the Orontes and the
Euphrates, dragging in their train a multitude of men and
women that had fallen into their hands; a great number of
waggons conveyed the spoils of the ravaged provinces they
passed through. The most brave of them ornamented their
lances with the hair of those they had immolated in fight.
Clothed in the produce of pillage, their army presented a
spectacle at once terrific and ridiculous. The Carismian
warriors had no resource but in victory, and all the harangues
of their leaders consisted of these words: <i>You will
conquer, or you will die</i>. They gave no quarter to their
enemies on the field of battle; when conquered themselves,
they submitted to death without a complaint. Their fury
spared neither Christians nor Mussulmans; all they met on
their passage were their enemies; their approach spread
terror everywhere, put the distracted peoples to flight, and
changed cities and towns into deserts.</p>

<p>The Mussulman powers of Syria several times united in a
league against the Carismians, and drove them back to the
other side of the Euphrates. But the spirit of rivalry
which at all times divided the princes of the family of
Saladin, soon recalled an enemy always redoubtable notwithstanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
defeats. At the period of which we are speaking,
the princes of Damascus, Carac, and Emessa had just formed
an alliance with the Christians of Palestine; they not only
restored Jerusalem, Tiberias, and the principality of Galilee
to them, but they promised to join them in the conquest of
Egypt, a conquest for which the whole of Syria was making
preparations. The sultan of Cairo, to avenge himself upon
the Christians who had broken the treaties concluded with
him, to punish their new allies, and protect himself from
their invasion, determined to apply for succour to the hordes
of Carismia; and sent deputies to the leaders of these barbarians,
promising to abandon Palestine to them, if they
subdued it.</p>

<p>This proposition was accepted with joy, and twenty thousand
horsemen, animated by a thirst for booty and slaughter,
hastened from the further parts of Mesopotamia, disposed
to be subservient to the vengeance or anger of the Egyptian
monarch. On their march they ravaged the territory of
Tripoli and the principality of Galilee, and the flames which
everywhere accompanied their steps, announced their arrival
to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Fortifications scarcely commenced, and the small number
of warriors in the holy city, left not the least hope of being
able to repel the unexpected attacks of such a formidable
enemy. The whole population of Jerusalem resolved to fly,
under the guidance of the knights of the Hospital and the
Temple. There only remained in the city the sick and a
few inhabitants who could not make their minds up to abandon
their homes and their infirm kindred. The Carismians
soon arrived, and having destroyed a few intrenchments that
had been made in their route, they entered Jerusalem sword
in hand, massacred all they met, and as, amidst a deserted
city the conquerors found no victims to glut their vengeance
with, they had recourse to a most odious stratagem to lure
back the inhabitants who had taken flight. They raised
the standards of the cross upon every tower, and set all the
bells ringing. The crowd of Christians who were retiring
towards Jaffa, marched on in silence, and advanced but
slowly, constantly hoping that Heaven would be touched by
their misery, and, by some miracle, lead them back to the
homes they had quitted: from time to time, their eyes involuntarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
turned towards the holy city. All at once they
saw the banners of the Cross unfurled, and the sound of the
sacred brass, which every day called them to prayers, resounded
in their ears. The news soon spread that either
the barbarians had marched their army in another direction,
or that they had been repulsed by the Christians who were
left in the city. They became soon persuaded that God had
taken pity on his people, and would not permit the city of
Christ to be defiled by the presence of a sacrilegious horde.
Seven thousand fugitives, deceived by this hope, returned
to Jerusalem and gave themselves up to the fury of the
Carismians, who put them all to the sword. Torrents of
blood flowed through the streets and along the roads. A
troop of nuns, children, and aged people, who had sought
refuge in the church of the Holy Sepulchre, were massacred
at the foot of the altars. The Carismians finding nothing
among the living to satisfy their fury, burst open the sepulchres,
and gave the coffins and remains of the dead up to
the flames; the tomb of Christ, that of Godfrey of Bouillon,
the sacred relics of the martyrs and heroes of the faith,
nothing was respected, and Jerusalem then witnessed within
its walls such cruelties and profanations as had never taken
place in the most barbarous wars, or in days marked by the
anger of God.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

<p>In the mean time, the grand masters of the Templars and
the Hospitallers, assembled with the patriarch of Jerusalem
and the nobles of the kingdom, in Ptolemaïs, endeavoured
to devise means by which the Carismians might be repulsed
and Palestine saved. All the inhabitants of Tyre, Sidon,
Ptolemaïs, and other Christian cities, able to bear arms, repaired
to their standards. The princes of Damascus, Carac,
and Emessa, whose assistance the Christians implored, united
their forces, and assembled an army to stop the progress of
the general devastation. This Mussulman army soon arrived
in Palestine. Its appearance before the walls of Ptolemaïs
raised the courage of the Franks, who, in so pressing a danger,
appeared to have no repugnance to fight in company
with the infidels. Almansor, prince of Emessa, who commanded
the Mussulman warriors, had recently signalized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
his valour against the hordes of Carismia. The Christians
took pleasure in relating his victories in the plains of
Aleppo, and on the banks of the Euphrates. He was received
in Palestine as a liberator, and carpets bordered with
gold and silk were spread upon his passage. “The people,”
says Joinville, “considered him as one of <i>the best barons of
paganism</i>.”</p>

<p>The preparations of the Christians, the zeal and ardour
of the military orders, the barons, and prelates; the union
that subsisted between the Franks and their new allies,
altogether seemed to form a presage of success in a war undertaken
in the names of religion, humanity, and patriotism.
The Christian and Mussulman armies, united under the
same banners, set out from Ptolemaïs, and encamped upon
the plains of Ascalon. The army of the Carismians advanced
towards Gaza, where they were to receive provisions and
reinforcements sent by the sultan of Egypt. The Franks
became impatient to meet their enemies, and to avenge the
deaths of their companions and brethren massacred at Jerusalem.
A council was called, to deliberate upon the best
mode of proceeding. The prince of Emessa and the more
wise among the barons thought it not prudent to expose the
safety of the Christians and their allies to the risk of a
battle. It appeared to them most advisable to occupy an
advantageous position, and wait, without giving battle, till
the natural inconstancy of the Carismians, want of provisions,
or discord, might assist in dispersing this vagabond
multitude, or lead them into other countries.</p>

<p>Most of the other chiefs, among whom was the patriarch
of Jerusalem, did not agree with this opinion, and could see
nothing in the Carismians but an undisciplined horde that
it would be very easy to conquer and put to flight: any
delay in attacking them would only raise their pride and redouble
their audacity. Every day the evils of war were increasing;
humanity and the safety of the Christian colonies
required that they should promptly put an end to so many
devastations, and that they should make haste to chastise
the brigands, whose presence was at once an opprobrium
and a calamity for the Christians, and all the allies of the
Christians.</p>

<p>This opinion, too congenial with the impatient valour of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
the Franks, prevailed in the council. It was resolved to
march, and offer the enemy battle.</p>

<p>The two armies met in the country of the ancient Philistines.
Some years before, the duke of Burgundy and the
king of Navarre, surprised in the sandy plains of Gaza, had
lost the best of their knights and soldiers. Neither the
sight of places where the Crusaders had been defeated, nor
the remembrance of their recent disaster, diminished the
imprudent ardour of the Christian warriors; as soon as
they perceived the enemy, they were eager for the signal for
battle. The Christian army was divided into three bodies;
the left wing, in which were the knights of St. John, was
commanded by Gauthier de Brienne, count of Jaffa, nephew
to king John, and son of that Gauthier who died at the conquest
of Naples. The Mussulman troops, under the orders
of the prince of Emessa, formed the right wing. The
patriarch of Jerusalem, surrounded by his clergy, with the
wood of the true cross borne before him, the grand master
of the Templars with his knights, and the barons of
Palestine with their vassals, occupied the centre of the
army.</p>

<p>The Carismians formed their line of battle slowly, and
some degree of disorder was observable in their ranks.
Gauthier de Brienne was anxious to profit by this circumstance
and attack them with advantage; but the patriarch
restrained his valour by a severity not less contrary to the
interests of the Christians than to the spirit of the Gospel.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<p>The count of Jaffa, having been excommunicated for detaining
in his hands a castle to which the prelate laid claim,
asked, before he commenced the encounter in which he
might lose his life, to be relieved from his excommunication.
The patriarch twice rejected his prayer, and refused to
absolve him. The army, which had received the benedictions
of the priests and bishops, arising from their knees, awaited
in silence the signal for battle. The Carismians had formed
their line and advanced, uttering loud cries and discharging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
a cloud of arrows. Then the bishop of Rama, in complete
armour, impatient to signalize his bravery against the
enemies of the Christians, approached the count of Jaffa, exclaiming,
“Let us march,&mdash;the patriarch is wrong: I absolve
you, in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost.” After having pronounced these words, the
intrepid bishop of Rama and Gauthier de Brienne, followed
by his companions in arms, rushed amidst the ranks of
the enemy, burning to obtain victory or the crown of martyrdom.</p>

<p>The two armies were soon generally engaged, and mingled
on the field of battle. The ardour to conquer was equal on
both sides; neither the Christians nor their enemies could
be ignorant that a single defeat must cause their ruin, and
that their only safety was in victory. On this account, the
annals of war present no example of a more murderous and
obstinate contest; the battle began with the dawn, and only
ended at sunset. On the following morning fighting was
renewed with the same fury; the prince of Emessa, after
having lost two thousand of his horsemen, abandoned the
field of battle, and fled towards Damascus. This retreat of
the Mussulmans decided the victory in favour of the Carismians;
the Christians for a long time sustained the repeated
shocks of the enemy; but at length, exhausted by fatigue
and overwhelmed by a multitude, almost all were either
killed or taken prisoners. This sanguinary battle cost life
or liberty to more than thirty thousand Christian and
Mussulman warriors; the prince of Tyre, the patriarch of
Jerusalem, and some of the prelates, with great difficulty
escaped the slaughter, and retired to Ptolemaïs. Among the
warriors who regained the Christian cities, there were only
thirty-three knights of the Temple, twenty-six Hospitallers,
and three Teutonic knights.</p>

<p>When the news of this victory reached Egypt, it created
a universal joy; it was announced to the people by sound
of drums and trumpets; the sultan ordered public rejoicings
throughout the provinces, and all the public edifices of the
capital were illumined during three nights. In a short
time the prisoners arrived at Cairo, mounted on camels, and
pursued by the insulting clamours of the multitude. Before
their arrival, the heads of their companions and brethren<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
killed at the battle of Gaza were exhibited on the walls.
This horrible monument of their defeat foreboded all they
had to fear for themselves from the barbarity of the conquerors.
They were cast into dungeons, where they were
abandoned to the mercies of cruel gaolers, and where they
had the melancholy satisfaction of embracing the barons
and knights made prisoners in the last crusade.</p>

<p>Whilst all Egypt was celebrating the victory of Gaza, the
inhabitants of Palestine deplored the death and captivity of
their bravest warriors. As long is any hope existed of conquering
the Carismians with the assistance of the Mussulmans
of Syria, their alliance had created neither mistrust
nor scruple; but reverses quickly revived prejudices; the
last disaster was attributed to divine justice, irritated by
having seen the banners of Christ mingled with those of
Mahomet. On the other hand, the Mussulmans believed
they had betrayed the cause of Islamism by allying themselves
with the Christians; the aspect of the cross on the
field of battle awakened their fanaticism and diminished
their zeal for a cause which appeared to be that of their
enemies. At the moment of beginning the fight, the prince
of Emessa was heard to pronounce these words: “I am
armed for battle, and yet God tells me, in the depths of my
heart, that we shall not be victorious, because we have
sought the friendship of the Franks.”</p>

<p>The victory of the Carismians delivered up the greater
part of Palestine to the most redoubtable enemies of the
Christian colonies. The Egyptians took possession of Jerusalem,
Tiberias, and the cities ceded to the Franks by the
prince of Damascus. The hordes of Carismia ravaged all
the banks of the Jordan, with the territories of Ascalon
and Ptolemaïs, and laid siege to Jaffa. They dragged the
unfortunate Gauthier de Brienne in their train, hoping that
he would cause a city that belonged to him to open its gates
to them: this model of Christian heroes was fastened to a
cross before the walls. Whilst thus exposed to the eyes of
his faithful vassals, the Carismians loaded him with insults,
and threatened him with instant death if the city of Jaffa
offered the least resistance. Gauthier, braving death, exhorted
the inhabitants and the garrison, with a loud voice.
to defend themselves to the last extremity. “Your duty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>”
cried he, “is to defend a Christian city; mine is to die for
you and Jesus Christ.” The city of Jaffa did not fall into
the hands of the Carismians, and Gauthier soon received
the reward of his generous devotedness. Sent to the sultan
of Cairo, he perished beneath the brutal blows of a furious
mob, and thus obtained the palm of martyrdom for which
he had wished.</p>

<p>In the mean time, fortune, or rather the inconstancy of
the barbarians, came to the assistance of the Franks, and
delivered Palestine from the presence of an enemy nothing
could resist. The sultan of Cairo sent robes of honour and
magnificent presents to the leaders of the victorious hordes,
proposing to them to crown their exploits by directing their
arms against the city of Damascus. The Carismians immediately
laid siege to the capital of Syria. Damascus, which
had been hastily fortified, was able to oppose but a very
slight resistance to their impetuous attacks. Having no
hope of succour, they opened their gates, and acknowledged
the domination of the sultan of Egypt. It was then that
the Carismians, inflated by their victory, demanded, in a
menacing tone, that the lands that had been promised to
them in Palestine should immediately be given up to them.
The sultan of Cairo, who dreaded such neighbours, attempted
to defer the fulfilment of his promise. In the fury which
his refusal created, the barbarians offered their services to
the prince whom they had just despoiled of his states, and
laid fresh siege to Damascus, in order to deprive the Egyptians
of it. The garrison and the inhabitants defended
themselves with obstinacy; the fear of falling into the hands
of a pitiless enemy supplying the place of courage. All the
evils that war brings in her train, even famine itself, appeared
to them a less terrible scourge than the hordes assembled
under their ramparts.</p>

<p>The sultan of Egypt sent an army to assist the city, which
was augmented by the troops of Aleppo and of several of
the principalities of Syria. The Carismians were conquered
in two battles. After this double defeat, Oriental history
scarcely mentions their name, or furnishes us with means of
following their track. The greater part of those that escaped
the sword perished with hunger and misery in the countries
they had devastated; the most brave and the best disciplined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
went to seek an asylum in the states of the sultan of Iconium:
and if faith can be given to the conjectures of some
historians,<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> they were the obscure origin of the powerful
dynasty of the Ottomans.</p>

<p>The Christians of Palestine must have been grateful to
Heaven for the destruction of the Carismians; but the loss
of Jerusalem and the defeat of Gaza could not permit them
to indulge in many joyful sensations. They had lost their
allies, and could reckon upon nothing but enemies among
the Mussulmans. The sultan of Egypt, whose alliance they
had rejected, was extending his dominions in Syria, and his
power became every day more formidable. The cities which
the Christians still retained on the coasts of the sea were
almost all without defenders. The orders of St. John and
the Temple had offered the sultan of Cairo a considerable
sum for the ransom of his prisoners; but the sultan refused
to listen to their ambassadors, and threatened them with all
the terrors of his wrath: these two bodies, formerly so much
dreaded by the Mussulmans, were no longer able to serve
the cause of the Christians with any advantage, and were
compelled to wait, in a state of inaction, till the warlike
nobility of Europe should come to replace the knights held
in captivity by the infidels, or swept away on the field of
battle. The emperor of Germany made not the least effort
to save the wreck of his feeble kingdom; he had sent several
warriors to protect his rights in Ptolemaïs; but as these
rights were not recognised, the presence of the imperial
troops only added to the other scourges that desolated the
Holy Land, that of discord and civil war.</p>

<p>Palestine, threatened every day with a fresh invasion,
could not entertain the smallest hope of being succoured by
the other Christian states of the East. The Comans, a
barbarous people from the confines of Tartary, and who
surpassed the hordes of Carismia in ferocity, ravaged the
banks of the Orontes, and submitted everything in the
principality of Antioch to fire and sword; the king of Armenia
was in dread, at the same time, of the ravages of the Tartars,
and of the aggressions of the Turks in Asia Minor;
the kingdom of Cyprus, a prey to factions, had recently been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
the theatre of a civil war, and had reason to fear the incursions
of the Mussulman nations of Syria and Egypt. In
this deplorable situation, it might be believed that the kingdom
of Godfrey was on the eve of perishing entirely, and
that all that remained of the Christians in the Holy Land
would soon share the fate of the Carismians. But, on
turning their eyes towards the West, the Franks of Palestine
again felt their hopes and their courage revive; more than
once the Christian states of Syria had owed their safety, and
even a few days of prosperity and glory, to the excess of
their abasement and misery. Their groans and complaints
were seldom heard in vain by the warlike nations of Europe,
and their extreme distress became almost always the signal
for a new crusade, the very report of which was enough to
make the Saracens tremble.</p>

<p>Valeran, bishop of Berytus, had been sent into the West
to solicit the protection of the pope and the assistance of
princes and warriors. The pope received the envoy of the
Christians with kindness, and promised his succour to the
Holy Land. But the West was at that period agitated by
troubles: the quarrel that had broken out between the Holy
See and the emperor of Germany was carried on with an
animosity that disgraced both religion and humanity. Frederick
II. exercised all sorts of violences against the court
of Rome and the partisans of the sovereign pontiff; the
pope, every day more irritated, invoked the arms of the
Christians against his enemy, and promised the indulgences
of the crusade to all who would minister to his anger.</p>

<p>On another side, the Latins established at Constantinople
were environed by the greatest perils. The emperor Baldwin
II., after having conducted a feeble reinforcement to
his capital, had returned into the West, and was, the second
time, soliciting the alms and the succours of the faithful to
sustain the deplorable remains of his empire, exposed, almost
without defence, to the attacks of the Greeks and Bulgarians.
At the same time, the Tartars continued to ravage
the banks of the Danube, and threaten Germany; their
barbarous exploits had carried terror to the very extremities
of Europe; everywhere the excited imagination of nations
represented these terrible conquerors as monsters vomited
up by hell, clothed in hideous forms, and endowed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
strength against which no man was able to contend. The
deficiency of communication, which did not allow of exact
information as to their march, gave birth to the most
frightful rumours. Fame declared at one time they were
invading Italy, and immediately afterwards, that they were
ravaging the banks of the Rhine; every nation dreaded
their prompt arrival, every city believed they were at its
gates.</p>

<p>It was amidst this general disorder and consternation, that
Innocent IV., a refugee at Lyons, resolved to convoke an
œcumenic council in that city, to remedy the evils that desolated
Christendom in both the East and the West.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> The
sovereign pontiff, in his letters addressed to the faithful,
exposed the deplorable situation of the Romish Church, and
conjured the bishops to come around him, and enlighten him
with their counsels. The patriarchs of Constantinople,
Antioch, and Aquilæa, a great number of prelates and doctors,
with several secular princes, responded to the invitation
of the head of the Church. Among the crowd of bishops,
one alone seemed to attract general attention; this was the
bishop of Berytus; his presence, and the grief impressed
upon his brow, reminded the assembly of all the misfortunes
of the Holy Land. Baldwin II., emperor of Byzantium,
created very little less notice; and his suppliant attitude
but too plainly showed what the empire founded by the
sixth crusade had become.</p>

<p>Most of the Western monarchs had sent their ambassadors
to this assembly, in which the safety and the great
interests of the Christian world were about to be discussed.
Frederick in particular, who had so long been the object of
the anger of the sovereign pontiff, neglected nothing to turn
aside the thunders suspended over his head, and ministers
invested with his confidence were commissioned to defend
him before the fathers of the council. Among the deputies
of the emperor of Germany, history names Pierre Desvignes,
who had written, in the name of Frederick, eloquent letters
to all the sovereigns of Europe, to complain of the tyranny
exercised by the Holy See; and Thadæus of Suesse, who was
not prevented by the profession of arms from employing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
arts of eloquence, or fathoming the depths of the study of
laws. The latter had often served his master with glory
amidst the perils of war, but he had never had an opportunity
of showing so much firmness, courage, and devotion as
in this assembly, in which the court of Rome was about to
put forth all its power and realize all its threats.</p>

<p>Before the opening of the council, the pope held a congregation
in the monastery of St. Just, where he had chosen to
fix his residence. The patriarch of Constantinople exposed
the deplorable state of his church: heresy had resumed its
empire in a great part of Greece, and the enemies of the
Latin church were advancing to the very gates of Constantinople;
the bishop of Berytus read a letter, in which the
patriarch of Jerusalem and the barons and prelates of Palestine
described the ravages of the Carismians, and showed
that the heritage of Christ was upon the point of becoming
the prey of the barbarians, if the West did not take arms
for its defence. The dangers and misfortunes of the Christians
of the East affected the fathers of the council deeply.
Thadæus, taking advantage of their emotion, announced that
the emperor, his master, fully partook of their profound grief,
and that he was ready to employ all his powers for the defence
of Christendom. Frederick promised to arrest the
progress of the irruption of the Tartars, to re-establish the
domination of the Latins in Greece, to go in person to the
Holy Land, and to deliver the kingdom of Jerusalem; he
still further promised, in order to put an end to all divisions,
to restore to the Holy See all he had taken from it, and to
repair all wrongs offered to the sovereign pontiff. Such
lofty promises, made by the most powerful monarch of Christendom,
created as much joy as surprise in the greater part
of the bishops; the whole assembly appeared impatient to
know what would be the reply of Innocent. The pope
proved inflexible, and rejected with scorn propositions, as he
said, already made several times, and which had no other
guarantee but the too suspicious loyalty of Frederick. He
was determined to view the new protestations of the emperor
as nothing but a fresh artifice to deceive the Church,
and turn aside the course of its justice. “<i>The axe</i>,” added he,
“<i>is already lifted, and ready to cut the roots of the tree</i>;” words
very ill assorted with the charity of the Gospel, and which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
plainly show that Innocent had prepared the solemn pomp of
a council with less purpose to oppose the foes of Christendom
than to prepare the fall, and consummate the ruin of his
personal enemy.</p>

<p>The pope held this preparatory sitting in order to make a
trial of his strength, and to become acquainted with the dispositions
of the bishops. A few days afterwards, the council
was opened with great solemnity in the metropolitan
church of St. John; the sovereign pontiff, wearing the tiara,
and clothed in pontifical robes, was placed upon an elevated
seat, having on his right hand the emperor of Constantinople,
and on his left the count of Provence and the count
of Thoulouse. After having given out the <i>Veni Creator</i>, and
invoked enlightenment from the Holy Ghost, he pronounced
a discourse, for the subject of which he took the five griefs
with which he was afflicted, and compared them to the five
wounds of the Saviour of the world upon the cross. The
first was the irruption of the Tartars; the second, the schism
of the Greeks; the third, the invasion of the Holy Land by
the Carismians; the fourth, the relaxation of ecclesiastical
discipline and the progress of heresy; and the fifth, the
persecution he endured from Frederick.</p>

<p>Whilst describing the misfortunes of Christendom, the
pontiff could not restrain his tears. His voice, if we may
believe a contemporary historian, was often stifled by sobs;
he conveyed to all hearts the sentiments by which he was
affected; but he soon abandoned the language of compassion
and despair, and assumed that of anger and menace. The
Tartars, the Carismians, and the Mussulmans, inspired him
with less hatred than the emperor of Germany, and it was
for this prince he reserved all the thunders of his eloquence.
He reproached him, in the most vehement expressions, with
all the crimes that could draw upon his head the maledictions
of his age, the hatred of his contemporaries, and the
contempt of posterity. When the pope had pronounced his
discourse, a profound silence reigned throughout the assembly;
it appeared to the greater part of the terrified bishops
that the voice of Heaven had made itself heard for the purpose
of condemning Frederick: all eyes were turned upon
the deputies of the emperor, and no one could believe that
either of them would dare to reply to the interpreter of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
anger of Heaven. All at once Thadæus of Suesse arose, and
addressed the council, calling upon God, who searches all
hearts, to witness that the emperor was faithful to all his
promises, and had never ceased to endeavour to serve the
cause of the Christians. He combated all the accusations of
the sovereign pontiff, and in his reply did not hesitate to
allege numerous complaints against the court of Rome.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>
The angry pope replied from his lofty throne; he again
accused the emperor, and evinced but too great a desire to
find him guilty: the first sitting of the council, entirely
occupied with these violent debates, exhibited the unedifying
spectacle of a contest between the head of the faithful, who
accused a Christian prince of perjury, felony, heresy, and
sacrilege; and the minister of an emperor, who reproached
the court of Rome with having exercised an odious despotism,
and committed revolting iniquities.</p>

<p>This contest, the results of which were likely to prove
equally injurious to the head of the Church and the head
of the Empire, was prolonged during several days; it doubtless
scandalized all those that the pope had not associated
with him in his resentments, and most of the bishops must
have been afflicted at being thus diverted from the principal
object of the convocation.</p>

<p>At length, however, the calamities of the Eastern Christians,
the captivity of Jerusalem, and the dangers of Byzantium
engaged the attention of the fathers of the council.
The pope and the assembly of prelates decided that a new
crusade should be preached for the deliverance of the Holy
Land and the Latin empire of Constantinople. They renewed
all the privileges granted to Crusaders by preceding
popes and councils, as well as all the penalties directed
against such as should favour either pirates or Saracens:
during three years all who should take the cross would be
exempted from every kind of tax or public office; but if after
taking the vow they did not perform it, they incurred excommunication.
The council recommended to the barons
and knights to reform the luxury of their tables and the
splendour of their dress; they advised all the faithful, and
particularly ecclesiastics, to practise works of charity, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
arm themselves with all the austerities of penitence against
the enemies of God. In order to obtain the protection of
Heaven by the intercession of the Holy Virgin, the pope
and the fathers of the council ordered that the octave of the
Nativity should be celebrated in the church. In several
councils Christian knights had been forbidden to take part
in the profane solemnities of tournaments; the council of
Lyon renewed the prohibition, persuaded that these military
festivals might turn aside the minds of the warriors from the
pious thoughts of the crusades, and that the expenses they
occasioned would render it impossible for the bravest of the
lords and barons to make the necessary preparations for the
pilgrimage beyond the seas. The council ordered that the
clergy should pay the twentieth part of their revenue, and
the sovereign pontiff and cardinals the tenth of theirs, to
provide for the expenses of the holy war. Half of the
revenues of all non-resident benefices was specially reserved
for the assistance of the empire of Constantinople. The
decrees of the council ordered all whose mission it was to
preach the word of God, to urge princes, counts, barons, and
the corporations of cities, to contribute to the extent of their
power to the success of the holy war; the same statutes recommended
the clergy to show to the faithful that sacrifices
offered to the crusade were the surest means of redeeming
their sins; but above all they recommended the clergy to
excite the faithful, in the tribunal of penitence, to multiply
their offerings, or at least to bequeath in their testaments
something for the assistance of the Christians of the East.</p>

<p>It was thus the council declared war against nations
opposed to the Christians, and prepared means for assuring
the triumphs of the soldiers of Christ. We are nevertheless
surprised that the pope said nothing about preaching a
crusade against the Tartars, whose invasion he had compared
to one of the wounds of the Saviour on the cross. In
the state of desolation in which Hungary was then placed,
none of the bishops of that unfortunate kingdom had been
able to appear at the council, and no friendly voice was
raised to direct attention to, or implore favour for the Hungarian
nation. The Tartars, it is true, repulsed by the duke
of Neustadt, had fallen back from the banks of the Danube;
but there was great reason to dread their return: to prevent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
fresh invasions, the council contented itself with advising
the Germans to dig ditches and build walls on the roads the
Tartarian hordes were likely to take. These measures, which
even then must have been known to be insufficient, assist us
at the present day in forming an opinion of the spirit of improvidence
and blindness which then presided over political
councils. Who can fail to be surprised at seeing, in an
assembly so grave as a council, Europe pressed to lavish its
treasures and sacrifice its armies for the deliverance of Constantinople
and Jerusalem, whilst the most redoubtable of
the barbarians were at their doors, and threatening to invade
their own territories?</p>

<p>We may, however, remark, that Frederick himself had
solicited the powers of Europe to assist him in repelling the
Tartars; and the pope took much less interest in succouring
the empire than he did in endeavouring to wrest it from
Frederick. Innocent seemed very little disposed to set an
example of that spirit of concord and charity which the
council had just recommended to Christian princes; history
can but deplore the zeal and ardour he evinced in carrying
out his projects of vengeance against the emperor of Germany,
at the risk of arousing evil passions, of perpetuating
discord, and thus giving up the West to the invasion of the
barbarians. In the second sitting of the council he was
preparing to crush his enemy and completely overwhelm
him with the weight of ecclesiastical power, when Thadæus
of Suesse demanded a delay of a few days, to allow the emperor
to come in person to justify his conduct and demonstrate
his loyalty. The defender of Frederick hoped that
the presence of a powerful monarch, by awakening in the
minds of the assembly the respect due to the majesty of
kings, would bring about the triumph of justice. The pope
consented, though very unwillingly, to defer the accomplishment
of his menaces; but the emperor could not condescend
to appear as a suppliant before an assembly convoked by
the most implacable of his enemies: he did not come to the
council, and when the required period of delay had expired,
the sovereign pontiff took advantage of his absence to reproach
him afresh with his bad faith, and his resistance to
the laws of the Church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<p>At the moment in which the assembly of the bishops
tremblingly awaited the terrible sentence, the English ambassadors
arose to complain of the agents of the court of
Rome, whose ambition and avarice were ruining the kingdom
of England; they at the same time protested against the
feudal supremacy which the pope, in consequence of a cession
made by King John, pretended to exercise over the
English monarchy and nation. These claims could not
restrain the ever-boiling anger of the sovereign pontiff. In
vain Thadæus again rose to urge that a great number of
bishops were absent&mdash;that several princes had not sent their
ambassadors to the council; in vain he declared that he
should appeal from this to a more numerous and more solemn
council; nothing could turn aside the storm or retard the
hour of vengeance. Innocent at first replied with moderation
to the deputies of England, and even to those of Frederick;
but soon assuming the tone of a judge and a master,
“I am,” said he, “the vicar of Jesus Christ; all that which
I shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, according to
the promises of the Son of God made to the prince of the
apostles; and therefore, after having deliberated upon it
with our brethren the cardinals, and with the council, I
declare Frederick attainted and convicted of sacrilege and
heresy, to be excommunicated and degraded from the empire;
I absolve from their oaths, for ever, all who have sworn
fidelity to him; I forbid any, under pain of excommunication
incurred by that single fault, to henceforth yield him
obedience; to conclude, I command the electors to elect
another emperor, and I reserve to myself the right of disposing
of the kingdom of Sicily.”</p>

<p>During the reading of this sentence, the pope and the
prelates held lighted wax tapers in their hands, and bent
towards the earth in sign of malediction and anathema.
The envoys of Frederick retired filled with confusion and
despair; Thadæus of Suesse was heard to pronounce these
words of the Scripture: “<i>O terrible day! O day of anger and
calamity!</i>” A deep and melancholy silence prevailed throughout
this assembly, into the bosom of which it appeared as if
the bolts of heaven had just fallen amidst awful peals. The
pope alone appeared collected, and his countenance was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
radiant with joy; he gave out the <i>Te Deum</i>, as if he had
obtained a victory over the infidels, and declared that the
council had terminated its labours.</p>

<p>Such was the council of Lyons, too celebrated in the annals
of the middle ages, which has frequently supplied the enemies
of religion with a pretext for attacking the judgments of the
Church. The pope in his opening discourse had deplored
the progress of heresy; but always more eager to combat
the enemies of his power than those of religion, he did not
propose a single measure to arrest the progress of the new
errors. In this council, which had no tendency to the enlightenment
of the faithful, the majesty of kings was violently
outraged; all the maxims of the rights of nations, and all the
precepts of scriptural charity were in it trampled under foot.
When Innocent announced the intention of deposing the
emperor, not a single bishop raised his voice to divert the
sovereign pontiff from this revolting use of his power. The
real wrongs that Frederick had committed against the
Church; the remembrance of the persecutions he had exercised
towards several bishops; the intention which they believed
he entertained of plundering the clergy; the threatening
language and tone of the pope; that invincible influence
under which all feel themselves in a numerous assembly&mdash;all
assisted in preventing any of the bishops from pleading the
cause of reason or recalling the maxims of the Gospel to the
mind of the enraged pontiff. Nevertheless the fathers of the
council, whatever might be their prejudices or their resentments,
did not take part in all the fury of Innocent, and did
not actively assist in carrying out his acts of injustice and
violence.</p>

<p>The pope did not appeal to their wisdom, and seemed
afraid to ask their opinions. Without repeating here that
which has frequently been said in schools of theology, impartial
history must disapprove of the silent neutrality of the
council; but it must at the same time assert that the odious
decree against Frederick was not an act of the Church; that
the bishops and prelates did not give their formal approbation
to it; and that the shame of this great iniquity fails
entirely upon the memory of Innocent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

<p>It was at this deplorable period that the cardinals, by
order of the pope, clothed themselves for the first time in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
the scarlet robe, a symbol of persecution, and a sad presage
of the blood that was about to flow. Frederick was at Turin
when he heard of his condemnation; at this news he called
for his imperial crown, and placing it upon his head, exclaimed
in a loud and angry voice, “There it is, and before
it shall be wrested from me, my enemies shall well know the
terror of my arms; let this pontiff tremble, who has broken
every tie that bound me to him; he at length permits me
henceforth to listen to nothing but the dictates of my just
anger.” These threatening words announced a formidable
contest, and every friend of peace must have been seized
with terror: the fury which animated the emperor and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
pope quickly passed into the minds of the people; in the
provinces of Germany and Italy all flew to arms. Amidst the
agitation in which the West was then plunged, it is probable
that Jerusalem and the Holy Land would have been quite
forgotten, if a powerful and highly-revered monarch had not
placed himself at the head of the crusade which had been
proclaimed in the council of Lyons.</p>

<p>The preceding year, at the very moment the nations of the
West heard of the last misfortunes of Palestine, Louis IX.
of France fell dangerously ill. The most earnest prayers
were offered up by the people of his kingdom for the preservation
of the virtuous monarch. The malady, the attacks
of which became every day more violent, at length created
serious alarm. Louis sunk into a mortal lethargy, and the
intelligence was soon circulated that he was dead. The
court, the capital, the provinces were struck with the deepest
grief; nevertheless, the king of France, as if Heaven had not
been able to resist the prayers and tears of a whole nation,
recovered, even when apparently at the portals of the tomb.
The first use he made of speech, after again beholding the
light, was to ask for the cross and express his determination
of going to the Holy Land.</p>

<p>Those who surrounded him considered his return to life
as a miracle effected by the crown of thorns of Christ, and
by the protection of the apostles of France; they cast themselves
on their knees to return thanks to Heaven, and in
the joy they experienced, scarcely paid attention to the vow
Louis had made of quitting his kingdom and going to fight
against the infidels in the East. When the king began to
recover his strength, he repeated his vow, and again asked
for the cross of the Crusaders.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> The queen Blanche, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
mother, the princes of his family, and Pierre d’Auvergne,
bishop of Paris, then endeavoured to divert him from his
purpose, and conjured him, with tears in their eyes, to wait
till he was perfectly restored to health before he directed his
thoughts to so perilous an enterprise; but Louis thought he
was only obeying the will of Heaven. His imagination had
been forcibly affected by the calamities of the Holy Land;
Jerusalem given up to pillage, the tomb of Christ profaned,
were constantly present to his mind. Amidst the height of
a burning fever, he had fancied he heard a voice which came
from the East, and addressed these words to him: “<i>King of
France, thou seest the outrages offered to the city of Christ;
it is thou whom Heaven hath appointed to avenge them</i>.”
This celestial voice resounded still in his ears, and would not
allow him to listen to the prayers of friendship or the counsels
of human wisdom. Steadfast in his resolution, he received
the cross from the hands of Pierre d’Auvergne, and
caused it to be announced to the Christians of Palestine&mdash;sending
them at the same time succours of both men and
money&mdash;that he would cross the seas as soon as he could
assemble an army, and had reëstablished peace in his
dominions.</p>

<p>This information, which conveyed such joy to the Christian
colonies, spread grief and consternation through all the
provinces of France. The sieur de Joinville expresses warmly
the regret of the royal family, particularly the despair of
the queen mother,<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> by saying, that when this princess saw
her son wearing the cross, <i>she was struck as fearfully as if
she had looked upon him dead</i>. The late disasters of Jerusalem
had drawn tears from most Christians in the West,
but without inspiring them, as in the preceding age, with
any earnest desire of going to fight the infidels. It was impossible
to see, in these distant expeditions, anything but
great perils and inevitable reverses; and the project of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
recovering the city of God awakened more alarm than
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The sovereign pontiff, however, sent ecclesiastics into all
the Christian states with a charge to preach the holy war.
Cardinal Eudes, of Chateauroux, arrived in France with the
express commission of publishing and causing to be executed
the decrees of the council of Lyons respecting the crusade.
The holy expedition was preached in all the churches of the
kingdom. Contemporary history scarcely mentions the effect
of these preachings, and everything leads us to believe that
those who then took the oath to fight against the Saracens
were induced to do so more by the example of the king than
by the eloquence of the holy orators.</p>

<p>In order to give more solemnity to the publication of the
crusade, and to excite the ardour of the warriors for the deliverance
of the holy places, Louis IX. convoked a parliament
in his capital, in which were assembled the prelates
and magnates of the kingdom. The cardinal legate there
repeated the exhortations addressed by the head of the
Church to the faithful. Louis IX. spoke after the cardinal
of Chateauroux, and retraced the picture of the disasters of
Palestine. “According to the expression of David, an impious
nation has entered into the temple of the Lord;
blood has flowed like water around Jerusalem; the servants
of God have been massacred in the sanctuary; and their
remains, deprived of sepulture, are abandoned to the birds
of heaven.” After having deplored the miseries of Sion,
Louis IX. reminded his barons and knights of the example
of Louis the Young and of Philip Augustus; he exhorted
every generous soldier who heard him to take arms, to go
across the seas, fight against the infidels, and defend the
glory of God and of the French name in the East. Louis,
invoking by turns the charity and the warlike virtues of
his auditory, endeavoured to awaken in all hearts both inspirations
of piety and sentiments of chivalry. There is no
necessity for repeating what was the effect of the exhortations
and prayers of a king of France who addressed himself
to the honour, and appealed to the bravery of his subjects.
He had scarcely ceased speaking, when his three brothers,
Robert, count d’Artois, Alphonse, duke of Poictiers, and
Charles, duke of Anjou, took the oath to go and defend the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
heritage of Christ and the French colonies in Asia. Queen
Marguerite, the countess d’Artois, and the duchess of Poictiers,
likewise took the cross and resolved to accompany their
husbands. Most of the bishops and prelates who were present
at this assembly, influenced by the discourse of the
king and the example of the cardinal-legate, did not hesitate
to enrol themselves in a war for which, it is true, less enthusiasm
was shown than had appeared in a former age, but
which was still termed <i>the war of God</i>. Among the great
vassals of the crown who swore to quit France for the purpose
of fighting the Saracens in Asia, the friends of the
French monarchy must have numbered, with much joy,
Pierre de Dreux, duke of Brittany, Hugh, count de la
Marche, and several other lords whose jealous ambition had
so long disturbed the kingdom. Quickly after them were
seen the duke of Burgundy, Hugh de Chatillon, the count
de St. Pol, the counts of Dreux, Bar, Soissons, Blois, Rhotel,
Montfort, and Vendôme; the seigneur de Beaujeu, constable
of France, and John de Beaumont, great admiral, and great
chamberlain; Philip of Courtenay, Guy of Flanders, Archambaud
de Bourbon, young Raoul de Coucy, John of
Barres, Gilles de Mailly, Robert de Bethune, and Oliver de
Thermes. There was not an illustrious family in the kingdom
that did not supply one hero for the crusade. In the
crowd of these noble Crusaders, history is gratified in observing
the celebrated Boilève, who was afterwards provost
of the traders of Paris, and the sieur de Joinville, whose
name will for ever appear in the history of France by the
side of that of Louis IX.</p>

<p>In the assembly of prelates and barons several measures
were adopted for the maintenance of public peace and the
preparations for the holy war. An immense number of processes
at that period disturbed the peace of families, and
those processes, of which many were decided by the sword,
often amounted to actual wars. The tribunals were enjoined
to terminate all affairs brought before them, and in cases in
which they could not oblige the parties to acquiesce in a
definite judgment, the judges were directed to make them
swear to a truce of five years. In agreement with the
authority of the pope, and the decrees of the council of
Lyons, it was ordered that ecclesiastics should pay to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
king the tenth of their revenues, which created a dissatisfaction
in the clergy that Louis had great trouble in dispelling.
A proscript, issued by royal authority, in concert with the
will of the pope, decreed that Crusaders should be protected
during three years from the pursuits of their creditors,
reckoning from the day of their departure for the Holy
Land; this proscript, which likewise excited much murmuring,
had great effect in determining many barons and knights
to leave the West.</p>

<p>Louis IX. occupied himself constantly in carrying his
design into execution, and neglected no means of winning to
his purpose all the nobility of his kingdom; his piety did
not disdain to employ, for what he considered a sacred cause,
all the empire that kings generally possess over their courtiers;
he sometimes even lowered himself to seduction and
trick, persuaded that the sanctity of the crusade would
excuse everything. After an ancient custom, the kings of
France, at great solemnities, gave such of their subjects as
were at court certain capes or furred mantles, with which
the latter immediately clothed themselves before leaving the
court. In the ancient <i>comptes</i> (a sort of audits) these capes
were called <i>livrées</i> (whence, no doubt, our word livery),
because the monarch gave them (<i>les livrait</i>) himself. Louis
ordered a vast number of these to be prepared against
Christmas Eve, upon which crosses were embroidered in
gold and silk. The moment being come, every one covered
himself with the mantle that had been given to him, and
followed the monarch to the chapel. What was their
astonishment when, by the light of the wax tapers, they at
once perceived upon all before them, and then upon themselves,
the sign of an engagement they had never contracted.
Such was, however, the character of the French knights,
that they believed themselves obliged to respond to this
appeal to their bravery; all the courtiers, as soon as divine
service was ended, joined in the laugh with <i>the skilful fisher
of men</i>,<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> and took the oath to accompany him into Asia.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all these efforts, the publication of the
holy war created in the nation much more sorrow than warlike
ardour, and the approaching departure of the monarch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
afflicted all France. Queen Blanche, and the most prudent
of the ministers, who had at first endeavoured to divert
Louis IX. from the crusade, repeated their attempts several
times: resolved to make a last effort, they went to the king
in a body. The bishop of Paris was at their head, and
spoke for all; this virtuous prelate represented to Louis,
that a vow made in the height of a disease ought not to
bind him in an irrevocable manner, particularly if the interests
of his kingdom imposed upon him the obligation of
dispensing with it. “Everything demanded the presence of
the monarch in his dominions; the Poitevins were threatening
to take up arms again; the war of the Albigeois was
ready to be rekindled; the animosity of England was
always to be dreaded, as it paid little heed to treaties; the
wars occasioned by the pretensions of the pope and the emperor
inflamed all the states adjoining to France, and the
conflagration was not unlikely to extend to that kingdom.”
Many of the nobles to whom Louis had confided the most
important functions of the state, spoke after the bishop of
Paris, and represented to the monarch that all the institutions
founded by his wisdom would perish in his absence;
that France would lose by his departure the fruits of the
victories of Saintes and Taillebourg, with all the hopes that
the virtues of a great prince made her entertain. Queen
Blanche spoke the last. “My son,” said she, “if Providence
has made use of me to watch over your infancy and preserve
your crown, I have perhaps the right to remind you of the
duties of a monarch, and of the obligations which the safety
of the kingdom over which God has placed you imposes upon
you; but I prefer speaking to you with the tenderness of a
mother. You know, my son, that I can have but few days
to live, and your departure leaves me only the thought of an
eternal separation: happy still if I die before fame may have
borne into Europe the intelligence of some great disasters.
Up to this day, you have disdained both my counsels and my
prayers; but if you will not take pity on my sorrows, think
at least of your children, whom you abandon in the cradle;
they stand in need of your lessons and your assistance;
what will become of them in your absence? are they not as
dear to you as the Christians of the East? If you were
now in Asia, and were informed that your deserted family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
was the sport and prey of factions, you would not fail to
hasten to us. Well! all these evils that my tenderness
makes me dread, your departure is most likely to give birth
to. Remain then in Europe, where you will have so many
opportunities of displaying the virtues of a great king, of a
king the father of his subjects, the model and support of the
princes of his house. If Christ requires his heritage to be delivered,
send your treasures and your armies into the East;
God will bless a war undertaken in his name. But this God,
who hears me, believe me, never commands the accomplishment
of a vow which is contrary to the great designs of his
providence. No; that God of mercy who would not permit
Abraham to complete his sacrifice, does not permit you to
complete yours, and expose a life upon which so entirely
depend both the fate of your family and the welfare of your
kingdom.”</p>

<p>On finishing these words, Queen Blanche could not restrain
her tears; Louis himself was deeply moved, and threw himself
into the arms of his mother; but soon resuming a calm
and serene countenance, he said: “My dear friends, you
know that all Christendom is acquainted with my resolution;
during several months the preparations for the crusade have
been carried on under my orders. I have written to all the
princes of Europe that I was about to leave my dominions
and to repair to Asia; I have announced to the Christians
of Palestine that I would succour them in person; I have
myself preached the crusade in my kingdoms; a host of
barons and knights have obeyed my voice, followed my example,
and sworn to accompany me into the East. What
do you now propose to me? to change my projects publicly
proclaimed, to do nothing that I have promised to do, or
that Europe expects of me, and to deceive at once the hopes
of the Church, of the Christians of Palestine, and of my
faithful nobility.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, as you think that I was not in possession
of my reason when I took the cross; well, I give it back to
you; there is that cross which gives you so much alarm, and
which I only took, you say, in a fit of delirium. But now
that I am in the full enjoyment of my reason I ask it of
you again, and I solemnly declare that no food shall enter
my mouth until you have returned it to me. Your reproaches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
and your complaints affect me with the deepest sorrow; but
learn to be better acquainted with my duties and your own;
aid me in seeking for true glory; second me in the powerful
cause in which I am engaged, and do not alarm yourselves
on account of my destiny or that of my family and people.
The God who made me victorious at Taillebourg will watch
over the designs and plots of our enemies; yes, the God
who sends me into Asia to deliver his heritage, will defend
that of my children, and pour his blessings upon France.
Have we not still her who was the support of my childhood
and the guide of my youth, her whose wisdom saved the
state in so many perils, and who, in my absence, will want
neither courage nor ability to crush factions? Allow me,
then, to keep all the promises I have made before God and
before men; and do not forget that there are obligations
which are sacred for me, and ought to be sacred for you&mdash;I
mean the oath of a Christian and the word of a king!”</p>

<p>Thus spoke Louis IX.: Queen Blanche, the bishop of
Paris, and the other counsellors of the king preserved a religious
silence, and from that time only thought of seconding
the endeavours the monarch was making to forward the
execution of an undertaking which appeared to emanate
from God.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p>The crusade was preached at this time in all the countries
of Europe; but as most states were filled with agitation and
discord, the voices of the sacred orators were lost amidst the
din of factions and the tumult of arms. When the bishop
of Berytus went into England, to entreat the English
monarch to succour the Christians of the East, Henry III.
was fully employed in repelling the aggressions of the king
of Scotland, and in appeasing the troubles of the country
of Wales. The barons menaced his authority, and did not
permit him to engage in a distant war. This prince not
only refused to take the cross, but forbade the preaching of
a crusade in his kingdom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>

<p>All Germany was in a blaze in consequence of the quarrel
between the Church and the Empire. After having
deposed the emperor at the council of Lyons, Innocent IV.
offered the imperial crown to any one who would take up
arms against the excommunicated prince, and bring about
the triumph of the Holy See. Henry, landgrave of Thuringia,
allowed himself to be seduced by the promises of the
sovereign pontiff, and was crowned emperor by the archbishops
of Mayence and Cologne, and a few other ecclesiastical
electors. From that event civil war broke out in all
parts; Germany was filled with missionaries from the pope,
with the power of the evangelical word against Frederick,
whom they styled the most redoubtable of infidels. The
treasures collected for the equipments of the holy war were
employed in corrupting fidelity, laying plots, fomenting treasons,
and keeping up troubles and discords; so that it may
well be supposed the cause of Christ and the deliverance of
Jerusalem were entirely forgotten.</p>

<p>Italy was not less agitated than Germany; the thunders
of Rome, so often hurled at Frederick, had redoubled the fury
of the Guelphs and the Ghibellines. All the republics of
Lombardy were leagued in opposition to the party of the
emperor; the threats and the manifestoes of the pope would
not allow a single city to remain neuter, or leave peace an
asylum in the countries situated between the Alps and
Sicily. The missionaries of Innocent employed, by turns,
the arms of religion and of policy; after having declared
the emperor to be a heretic and an enemy to the Church,
they represented him as a bad prince and a tyrant, and
dazzled the eyes of the people with the charms of liberty,
always so powerful a motive upon the minds of nations.
The sovereign pontiff sent two legates into the kingdom of
Sicily, with letters for the clergy, the nobility, and the people
of the cities and country. “We have not been able to
see without some surprise,” wrote Innocent, “that, burdened
as you are, living under the opprobrium of servitude,
and oppressed in your persons and your property, you have
hitherto neglected the means of securing yourselves the
sweets of liberty. Many other nations have presented you
with an example; but the Holy See, far from accusing you,
is satisfied with pitying you, and finds your excuse in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
fear that must hold possession of your hearts under the yoke
of a new Nero.” On terminating his letter to the Sicilians,
the pope endeavoured to make them understand that God
had not placed them in a fertile region and beneath a smiling
sky to wear disgraceful chains; and that by shaking off
the yoke of the emperor of Germany, they would only
second the views of Providence.</p>

<p>Frederick, who had at first defied the thunders of Rome,
was terrified at the new war declared against him by the
pope. The interdict placed upon his states, the terrible
array of the maledictions of the Church, strongly affected
the minds of the multitude, and might at length shake the
fidelity of his subjects; he himself felt his courage forsake
him; his party in Italy grew weaker every day; his armies
had experienced some checks in Germany; many conspiracies
had been formed against his life, and amongst the conspirators,
he had the grief to find some of his servants
whom he had loaded with kindnesses. This haughty
monarch became convinced that he had no course but to
seek a reconciliation with the Church, and addressed himself
to Louis IX., whose wisdom and piety rendered him the
arbiter of sovereigns and nations. Frederick, in his letters,
promised to abide by the decision of the king of France and
his barons, and engaged, beforehand, to go in person to the
conquest of the Holy Land, or to send his son, the king of
the Romans. In order to interest Louis in his cause, the
emperor offered to supply him with provisions, vessels, and
everything he should stand in need of in the expedition to
the East.</p>

<p>Louis eagerly embraced this opportunity for reëstablishing
peace in Europe and assuring the success of the holy
war. Several ambassadors were sent to the pope at Lyons,
conjuring the father of the faithful to listen to the voice of
mercy rather than to that of anger. The king of France
had two long conferences with Innocent in the monastery
of Cluni, and supplicated him afresh to appease by his clemency
the troubles of the Christian world; but enmity had
been carried too far to leave any hopes of peace; it was not
possible for Innocent and Frederick to pardon each other
sincerely the outrages they had mutually committed. The
emperor had spared neither threats nor violences against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
popes; he did not hate them more for the injuries he had
received from them than for those he had done them. On
the other side, it had for a length of time been determined,
in the councils of Rome, to effect the overthrow of the house
of Swabia, which was suspected, and with reason, of entertaining
the project of invading Italy and establishing the
seat of imperial domination in the city of St. Peter. This
policy, embraced with ardour, had assumed all the character
of a personal vengeance in the mind of Innocent. The
triumph, even, of the pontiff, whilst flattering his pride and
ambition, appeared to double his hatred, and the hope of
completing the ruin of his enemy rendered him implacable.</p>

<p>In vain the emperor of Germany, overcome by fear rather
than won by the love of peace, promised to descend from his
throne, and pass the remainder of his days in Palestine, on
condition that he should receive the benediction of the pope,
and that his son Conrad should be raised to the empire. This
entire abnegation of power, this strange abasement of royal
majesty, produced no effect upon Innocent, who did not believe,
or feigned not to believe, the promises of Frederick;
in vain Louis IX., whose mind was incapable of suspecting
imposture, represented to the pope the advantages that
Europe, Christendom, and the court of Rome itself might
derive from the repentance and offers of the emperor; in
vain he spoke to him of the vows and the safety of pilgrims,
of the glory and peace of the Church; the discourses of the
holy king were scarcely listened to, and his pious mind could
not view, without being moved with disgust, this inflexible
rigour in the father of the Christian world.</p>

<p>Whilst the report of these discords, upon gaining the
East, spread joy among the infidels, the unhappy inhabitants
of Palestine gave themselves up to despair on learning that
so many untoward events retarded the preparations for the
crusade. Several messages from the Christians beyond the
seas were sent to the sovereign pontiff to intercede for a
prince from whom they hoped for such powerful assistance.
The patriarch of Armenia wrote to the court of Rome to
demand favour for Frederick; he demanded it in the name
of the threatened Christian colonies; in the name of the city
of God, fallen into ruins; in the name of the sepulchre of
Christ, profaned by barbarians. The pope made no reply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
whatever to the patriarch of the Armenians, and appeared
to have forgotten Jerusalem, the holy sepulchre, and the
Christians of Syria; he had, indeed, but one thought,&mdash;that
of carrying on the war against Frederick. Innocent pursued
his redoubtable enemy even to the East, and endeavoured to
induce the sultan of Cairo to break his engagements with
the emperor of Germany. The sultan of Cairo received,
with as great joy as surprise, a message which informed him
so authentically of the divisions that existed among the
Christian princes; he answered the pope with a severity full
of contempt; and the more he was pressed to be unfaithful
to the treaties made with Frederick, the more he affected to
display a fidelity from which he hoped to obtain an advantage
over the Christian Church.</p>

<p>It was at this period that the emperor of Germany, urged
on to despair, in some sort justified the most violent proceedings
of the court of Rome by his conduct. He could
not pardon Louis IX. for having remained neuter in a
quarrel that interested all Christendom, and if the Arabian
historian Yafey may be believed, he sent an ambassador
secretly into Asia to warn the Mussulman powers of the
expedition projected by the king of France. Throwing off
at once the tone of submission to the pope, he resolved to
repel force by force, and violence by violence. Some successes
which he obtained in Germany, raised his courage,
and completely dissipated all his scruples. He laid siege to
the city of Parma, at the head of a formidable army. Horrible
cruelties signalized his first triumphs; the bishop of
Arezzo, who fell into his hands, with many other prisoners
of war, were loaded with irons, and handed over to the
executioner without even the ceremony of a trial.</p>

<p>In the intoxication of success, Frederick threatened to
cross the Alps, and attack Innocent within the walls of
Lyons. Heaven, however, would not permit the execution
of a project formed by hatred and revenge. The Guelphs
beat and dispersed the imperial army. Fortune changed,
and the irresolute character of Frederick changed as suddenly
with it. Victory had inflamed his pride and redoubled
his fury; a single defeat cast him into despondency, and
rendered him again accessible to fear. From that time he
resumed the part of a suppliant to the pope; from that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
time protestations and prayers seemed to cost his terrified
mind no effort.</p>

<p>As the extent of his empire gave umbrage to the court of
Rome, Frederick promised to divide his dominions, and give
Sicily to his son Henry, and Germany to his son Conrad.
He submitted his religious belief to the examination of
several bishops, and sent their decision to the pope. He
went at last even so far as to promise to come in person to
solicit the clemency of Innocent. The sovereign pontiff had
just caused the count of Holland to be nominated emperor,
in the place of the landgrave of Thuringia, who had died on
the field of battle. In this state of things he dreaded less
the hostilities and angry threats of Frederick, than he did
his protestations of submission and repentance. The supplications
of princes and nations, who demanded favour for
a power he wished to destroy, annoyed Innocent; they
seemed to accuse him, in the eyes of Christendom, of obstinacy
in his refusal, and without inducing him to renounce
his policy, only embarrassed him in the execution of his
designs.</p>

<p>The pope remained constantly inflexible; but astonished
Europe began to ask what powerful interest it was that
commanded all these rigours. Frederick, pursued with so
much inveteracy, found at length the number and zeal of
his friends and partisans increase. Germany, Cologne,
and several other cities, rejected the decrees of the Holy
See, and proceeded to violent excesses. The angry pope
launched all his thunders against the guilty, and by an
injustice which characterizes these times of discord and vengeance,
many of the penalties he pronounced extended to
the fourth generation. This senseless rage completed the
alienation of men’s minds, and the fanaticism of heresy was
added to the furies of civil war.</p>

<p>As the court of Rome, under the imposing pretext of the
crusade, levied tributes in all the states of Europe to keep
up the fire of sedition and revolt, so many violences, and so
much injustice infused dissatisfaction everywhere, and gave
birth to a spirit of opposition among nations even, that had
been exempt from the consequences of the terrible quarrel.
The commissaries of the Holy See ruined the provinces of
France; they pervaded the cities and countries, compelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
the curates and chaplains of the nobles to sell all their little
property; they required from all, church dues; and from religious
communities, now the twentieth for the crusade against
Constantinople, then the tenth for that of Palestine, and at
last a contribution towards carrying on the war against the
emperor. The French nobility, stimulated by a feeling of
patriotism, by the spirit of chivalry which led all the <i>preux</i>
of that time to enter the lists against iniquity of any kind,
and perhaps also by the fear of being oppressed in their
turn, spoke loudly in favour of Frederick, and expressed
their anger at seeing the kingdom of France a prey to the
agents of the pope. Just remonstrances were at first made;
but in a short time no measures were observed, and they
proceeded so far as to agitate the question, whether they
ought to acknowledge a pontiff, whose conduct appeared so
contrary to the spirit of the Gospel, as the vicar of Jesus
Christ. The principal French nobles at length formed a
confederacy against the proceedings of the pope and the
clergy. Throughout this new struggle, Louis IX., equally
removed from that sacrilegious impiety which pretends to
brave everything, and from that superstitious pusillanimity
which believes itself obliged to suffer everything, managed
to restrain the excesses of both parties, and maintain peace;
the league which was then formed, without embittering
men’s minds, succeeded in enlightening them; it served,
during the absence of the king, to repress the enterprises of
the Holy See, and many writers trace to this period the
origin of those Gallican liberties which have constituted the
glory of the French clergy up to modern times.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Louis IX. was constantly employed in preparations
for his departure. As no other route to the East
was available but that by sea, and as the kingdom of France
had no port in the Mediterranean, Louis made the acquisition
of the territory of Aigues-Mortes, in Provence; the port,
choked with sand, was cleansed, and a city large enough to
receive the crowd of pilgrims was built on the shore. Louis
at the same time busied himself in provisioning his army,
and preparing magazines in the isle of Cyprus, where he
meant to land. Thibault, count de Bar, and the sieur de
Beaujeu, sent into Italy, found everything necessary for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
provisioning and transport of an army, either in the republic
of Venice, or in the rich provinces of Apulia and Sicily,
whither the directions of the emperor Frederick had preceded
them.</p>

<p>The fame of these preparations soon reached Syria, and
the authors of the times describe the Mussulman powers as
struck with terror, and as immediately and earnestly employed
in fortifying their cities and their frontiers against the
approaching invasion of the Franks. Such popular rumours
as were then in circulation that history has deigned to preserve,
accuse the Saracens of having employed perfidious
means and odious stratagems to avenge themselves upon the
Christian nations, and ruin their enterprise. It was asserted
that the life of Louis IX. was in danger from the emissaries
of the Old Man of the Mountain; it was reported in cities,
and the multitude did not fail to give credit to it, that the
pepper which came from the East was empoisoned; and
Matthew Paris, a grave historian, does not hesitate to affirm
that a great number of persons died of it before this horrible
artifice was discovered. We may well believe that the policy
of the time itself invented these gross fables, to render the
enemies they were about to combat more odious, and that
indignation might increase and animate the courage of the
warriors. It is natural also to suppose, that such rumours
had their origin in popular ignorance, and that they gained
credit from the opinion that was then entertained of the
manners and characters of infidel nations.</p>

<p>Three years had passed away since the king of France
assumed the cross. He convoked a new parliament at
Paris, in which he at length fixed the departure of the holy
expedition for the month of June of the following year
(1248). The barons and prelates renewed with him the
promises of fighting against the infidels, and engaged to set
out at the period assigned, under the penalty of incurring
ecclesiastical censures. Louis took advantage of the moment
that the magnates of his kingdom were assembled in
the name of religion, to require that they should take the
oath of fealty and homage to his children, and to make
them swear (these are the expressions of Joinville) “that
they should be loyal to his family, if any misadventure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
should befall his person in the holy voyage beyond the
seas.”<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

<p>It was then that the pope addressed a letter to the nobility
and people of France, in which he celebrated in solemn terms
the bravery and other warlike virtues of the French nation
and its pious monarch. The sovereign pontiff gave his benediction
to the French Crusaders, and threatened with the
thunders of the Church all who, having made the vow of
pilgrimage, deferred their departure. Louis IX., who had
no doubt requested this warning from the pope, saw with
joy all the nobility of his kingdom hasten to join his standard;
many nobles, whose ambition he had repressed, were
the first to set the example, for fear of awakening old mistrusts
or incurring fresh disgraces; others, seduced by the
habitual spirit of courts, declared themselves with ardour
champions of the cross, in the hope of obtaining, not the
rewards of Heaven, but those of the earth. The character
of Louis IX. inspired the greatest confidence in all the
Christian warriors. “If, till this time,” said they, “God
has permitted the crusades to be nothing but a long course
of reverses and calamities, it is because the imprudence of
the leaders has compromised the safety of the Christian
armies; it is because discord and licentiousness of manners
have reigned too long among the defenders of the cross: but
what evils have we to dread under a prince whom Heaven
appears to have inspired with its own wisdom,&mdash;under a
prince who, by his firmness, has succeeded in suppressing
every division in his own country, and is about to exhibit to
the East an example of all the virtues?”</p>

<p>Many English nobles, among whom were the earls of
Salisbury and Leicester, resolved to accompany the king of
France, and share with him the perils of the crusade. The
earl of Salisbury, grandson of “Fair Rosamond,” who had
gained by his exploits the surname of “Long Sword,” had
just been stripped of all his possessions by Henry III. In
order to place himself in a condition to make preparations
for the war, he addressed himself to the pope, and said to
him, “Beggar as I am, I have made a vow to perform the
pilgrimage to the Holy Land. If Prince Richard, brother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
to the king of England, has been able to obtain, without
taking the cross, the privilege of levying a tax upon those
who have just laid it down, I have thought that I might
obtain a similar favour;&mdash;I, who have no resource but in
the charity of the faithful.” This discourse, which informs
us of a very curious fact, made the sovereign pontiff smile:
the earl of Salisbury obtained the favour he asked, and
deemed it his duty to set out for the East.</p>

<p>The preachings for the holy war, which had produced but
little effect in Italy and Germany, had nevertheless been
successful in the provinces of Friesland and Holland, and in
some of the northern kingdoms. Haco, king of Norway,
celebrated for his bravery and exploits, took the oath to
fight against the infidels; and the Norwegians, who had
several times distinguished themselves in the holy wars,
followed the example of their monarch. Haco, after completing
his preparations, wrote to Louis IX. to announce
his approaching departure. He asked him permission to
land upon the coast of France, and to furnish himself there
with the supplies necessary for his army. Louis made a
most cordial reply, and proposed to the Norwegian prince to
share with him the command of the crusade. Matthew Paris,
who was charged with the message from Louis IX., informs
us in his History that the king of Norway declined the generous
offer of the French king, persuaded, he said, that harmony
could not long subsist between the Norwegians and
the French,&mdash;the first, of an impetuous, restless, and jealous
character, the others, full of pride and haughtiness.</p>

<p>Haco, after having made this reply, thought no more of
embarking, and remained quietly in his kingdom, history
being perfectly unable to discover the motives which produced
this sudden change. It may be believed, that in
accordance with the example of several other Christian monarchs,
this prince had made use of the crusade as a cloak
for his political designs. By levying a tax of a third upon
the revenues of the clergy, he had amassed treasures which
he might employ in strengthening his power. The army he
had raised in the name of Christ might minister to his ambition
much more effectually in Europe than in the plains of
Asia. The pope, from whom he had received the title of
king, at first exhorted him to assume the sign of the Crusaders;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
but everything leads us to believe that he afterwards
advised him to remain in the West, where he hoped to raise
in him one more enemy against the emperor of Germany.
Thus the king of Norway had promised to go into the East
in the hope of obtaining the favour and protection of the
court of Rome; and to preserve this favour and this support,
he had but one thing to do, and that was to forget his
promises.</p>

<p>However this may be, it is certain that the pope, at that
time, took but very little interest in the success of the
eastern crusade. We may judge of this by the facility
with which he liberated so many from their vows of fighting
against the infidels: he went even so far as to forbid the
Crusaders from Friesland and Holland to embark for Palestine.
In vain Louis IX. made some serious remonstrances
on this head; Innocent would not listen to him. Engrossed
by one passion, he found it much more advantageous to
grant dispensations for the voyage to Syria; for, on one
part, those dispensations which were bought with solid
money, contributed to fill his treasury, and on the other,
they left soldiers in Europe that he might arm against his
personal enemies.</p>

<p>Thus France was the only country in which the crusade
was really an object of interest; the piety and zeal of
Louis IX. brought back all those whom the indifference of
the pope had cooled; and the love of the French for their
king, replacing religions enthusiasm, sufficed for the removal
of all obstacles. The cities whose liberties the monarch
had protected, voluntarily sent him considerable sums. The
farmers of the royal domains, which were then very extensive,
advanced the revenues of a year. The rich taxed themselves,
and poured their hoards into the coffers of the king;
poverty dropped its mite into the poor-boxes of churches;
and we may add, that at that period there was scarcely a will
made in the kingdom which did not contain some legacy
towards the expenses of the holy war. The clergy were not
content with addressing prayers to Heaven for the crusade,
they paid the tenth of their revenues for the support of the
soldiers of the cross.</p>

<p>The barons, nobles, and princes, who equipped themselves
at their awn expense, imposed taxes on their vassals, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
found, after the example of the king of France, the money
necessary for the voyage in the revenues of their domains
and in the pious generosity of the towns and cities. Many,
as in other crusades, pledged their lands, sold their property,
and ruined themselves, to provide means to support their
soldiers and knights. They forgot their families, they forgot
themselves in the sad preparations for departure, and appeared
never to look forward to the period of return. Many prepared
themselves for the voyage as they would have prepared
for exile or death; the most pious of the Crusaders, as if
they only went to the East to find a tomb, were particularly
anxious to appear before God in a state of grace; they expiated
their sins by penitence; they pardoned offences,
repaired the ill they had done, disposed of their goods, gave
them to the poor, or divided them amongst their natural
heirs.</p>

<p>This disposition of men’s minds was greatly to the advantage
of humanity and justice; it imparted generous sentiments
to people of property; whilst, in the wicked, it
awakened a remorse that was nearly allied to virtue. Amidst
civil wars and feudal anarchy, a crowd of men had enriched
themselves by strife, rapine, and brigandage; religion inspired
them with a salutary repentance, and this time of
penitence was marked by a great number of restitutions,
which for a moment made the triumphs of iniquity to be
forgotten. The famous count de la Marche set the example;
his conspiracies, his revolts, his unjust enterprises had often
troubled the peace of the kingdom, and ruined a great
number of families; he became desirous of expiating his
faults; and to mitigate the just anger of God, he, by his will,
ordered a complete restitution to be made of all the property
he had acquired by injustice and violence.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> The sieur de
Joinville tells us, with great simplicity, in his History,
that his conscience did not reproach him with anything
serious, but that, nevertheless, he assembled his vassals and
neighbours to offer them reparation for the wrongs he might
have done them without knowing it.</p>

<p>In those days of repentance monasteries were founded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
and treasures lavished on churches: “The most sure means,”
said Louis IX., “to avoid perishing like the impious, is to
love and enrich the place in which dwells the glory of the
Lord.” The piety of the Crusaders was not forgetful of the
poor and infirm; their numerous offerings endowed cloisters
as asylums for want; hospices, or small convents, for the reception
of pilgrims; and particularly leper hospitals, which
were established in all the provinces, the melancholy abodes
of victims of the holy wars.</p>

<p>Louis IX. distinguished himself by his liberality towards
churches and monasteries; but that which must particularly
have drawn upon him the blessings of his people, was the
care he took to repair all injustice committed in the administration
of government. The holy monarch knew, that if
kings are the images of God upon earth, they are never
so truly so as when justice is seated beside them on the
throne. Restitution-offices, established by his orders in the
royal domains, were charged with the repairing of all wrongs
that might have been committed by the agents or farmers
of the king. In most of the great cities it was the duty of
two commissaries, one an ecclesiastic, the other a layman,
to hear and decide upon complaints made against his
ministers and officers: a noble exercise of the supreme
authority, which rather employs itself in seeking out the
unfortunate to assist them, than the guilty to punish them!
which watches for the murmurs of the poor, encourages the
weak, and submits itself to the tribunal of the laws! It
was not sufficient for Louis to have established regulations
for the administration of justice,&mdash;their execution excited
his most anxious solicitude. Preachers announced the
intentions of the king in all the churches, and as if he
thought himself responsible to God for all judgments pronounced
in his name, the monarch secretly sent holy
ecclesiastics and good monks to make fresh observations,
and learn from faithful reporters, if the judges whom he
believed to be worthy men, were not themselves corrupt.
The historian pauses complacently over this touching picture;
so noble an example presented to the kings of the earth,
appeared likely to bring down the blessings of Heaven upon
Saint Louis; and when we reflect upon the deplorable results
of this crusade, with the chroniclers of his own time, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
feel astonished that so many calamities should have been the
reward of such exalted virtue.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p>

<p>The preparations were now carried on with redoubled zeal
and activity; all the provinces of France appeared to be in
arms; the people of cities and country had but one thought,
and that was the crusade. The great vassals assembled their
knights and troops; the nobles and barons visited each
other, or exchanged messengers, in order to settle the day of
their departure. Relations and friends engaged to unite their
banners, and place everything in common&mdash;money, glory,
and perils. Devotional practices were mingled with military
preparations. Warriors were seen laying aside the cuirass
and sword, and walking, barefooted and in their shirts, to
visit monasteries and churches, to which the relics of saints
attracted the concourse of the faithful. Processions were
formed in every parish; all the Crusaders appeared at the
foot of the altars, and received the symbols of pilgrimage
from the hands of the clergy. Prayers were put up in all
churches for the success of the expedition. In families,
abundance of tears were shed at the moment of departure;
and most of the pilgrims, on receiving these last endearments
of their friends, seemed to feel, more than ever, the value of
all they were leaving behind them. The historian of Saint
Louis tells us, that after visiting Blanchicourt and Saint-Urbain,
where holy relics were deposited, he would not once
turn his eyes towards Joinville, for his heart was softened at
the idea of the beautiful castle he was leaving, and of his
two children.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> The leaders of the crusade took with them
all the warlike youth, and left in many countries nothing
but a weak and unarmed population; many abandoned
castles and fortresses must, naturally, fall to ruins; much
flourishing land must be changed into a desert, and a vast
many families must be left without support. The people,
no doubt, had cause to regret the nobles whose authority
was supported by kindnesses, and who, after the example of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
Saint Louis, loved truth and justice, and protected the weak
and the innocent; but there were some whose departure
was witnessed with gladness; and more than one town, more
than one village, rejoiced at seeing the donjon, from which
they had been accustomed to experience all the miseries of
servitude, empty and abandoned.</p>

<p>It was an affecting spectacle to see the families of artisans
and poor villagers lead their children to the barons and
knights, and say to them: “You will be their fathers; you
will watch over them amidst the perils of war and of the
sea.” The barons and knights promised to bring back their
soldiers to the West, or to perish with them in fight; and
the opinion of the people, the nobility, and the clergy, devoted,
beforehand, all who should fail in this sacred promise,
to the anger of God and the contempt of men.</p>

<p>Amidst these preparations, the most profound calm prevailed
throughout the kingdom. In all preceding crusades,
the multitude had exercised great violence against the Jews;
but by the firmness and wisdom of Saint Louis, the Jews,
though depositaries of immense wealth, and always skilful
in taking advantage of circumstances to enrich themselves,
were respected among a nation they had plundered, and
which was now completing its own ruin by the holy war.
Adventurers and vagabonds were not admitted beneath the
banners of the cross; and, upon the demand of Saint Louis,
the pope forbade all who had committed great crimes to
take up arms in the cause of Christ. These precautions,
which had never been observed in former crusades, were
highly calculated to insure the maintenance of order and
discipline in the Christian army. Among the crowd that
presented themselves to go into Asia, artisans and labourers
met with the best reception,&mdash;which is a remarkable circumstance,
and clearly proves that views of a wise policy were
mingled with sentiments of devotion, and that, though the
ostensible object was the deliverance of Jerusalem, hopes
were entertained of founding useful colonies in the East.</p>

<p>At the appointed time Louis IX., accompanied by his
brothers, the duke of Anjou and the count d’Artois, repaired
to the abbey of St. Denis.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> After having implored the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
support of the apostles of France, he received from the
hands of the legate the pilgrim’s staff and scrip, and that
oriflamme which his predecessors had already twice unfurled
before the nations of the East. Louis then returned to
Paris, where he heard mass in the church of Notre Dame.
The same day he quitted his capital, not again to enter it
before his return from the Holy Land. The people and
clergy were softened to tears, and accompanied him to the
abbey of St. Antoine, singing psalms by the way. There
he mounted on horseback to go to Corbeil, at which place
the Queen Blanche and Queen Marguerite were to meet
him.</p>

<p>The king gave two more days to the affairs of his kingdom,
and confided the regency to his mother, whose firmness
and wisdom had defended and preserved the crown during
the troubles of his minority. If anything could excuse
Louis IX., and justify his pious obstinacy, it was his leaving
his country in profound peace. He had renewed the truce
with the king of England; and Germany and Italy were so
occupied with their own internal discords, that they could
not give France the least subject for alarm. Louis, after
having employed every precaution against the spirit of disaffection,
took with him into the Holy Land almost all the
powerful nobles that had disturbed the kingdom. The
county of Mâcon, sold at the end of the preceding crusade,
had recently reverted to the crown; Normandy had escaped
from the yoke of the English; the counties of Thoulouse
and Provence, by the marriage of the counts of Anjou and
Poictiers, were about to become apanages of the princes of
the royal family. Louis IX., after he took the cross, never
ceased in his endeavours to preserve the recent conquests of
France, to appease the murmurs of the people, and remove
every pretext for revolt. The spirit of justice, which was
observable in all his institutions; the remembrance of his
virtues, which appeared more estimable amidst the general
grief caused by his departure; the religion which he had
caused to flourish by his example, were quite sufficient to
maintain order and peace during his absence.</p>

<p>As soon as Louis had placed the administration of his
kingdom in other hands, he gave himself up to the exercises
of piety, and appeared to be no more than the most meek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
of Christians. The dress and attributes of a pilgrim became
the only adornments of a powerful monarch. He wore no
more splendid stuffs, no more valuable furs; his arms even,
and the harness of his horses, glittered with nothing but the
polish of steel and iron. His example had so much influence,
says Joinville, that on the voyage not a single instance
of an embroidered coat was seen, either upon the king or
any one else. When endeavouring to reform splendour in
equipages or dress, Louis caused the money he had been
accustomed to expend in these to be distributed to the poor.
Thus royal magnificence was in him nothing but the luxury
of charity.</p>

<p>Queen Blanche accompanied him as far as Cluny. This
princess was persuaded she should never see her son again
until they met in heaven, and took leave of him in the most
affectionate manner; the tears of mother and son bearing
witness to the truth of their grief at parting. On his way,
he saw the pope at Lyons, and conjured him, for the last
time, to be merciful to Frederick, whom reverses had humiliated,
and who implored pardon. After having represented
the great interests of the crusade, after having spoken in
the name of the numerous pilgrims who were abandoning
everything for the cause of Christ, the pious mind of the
king was astonished to find the pontiff still inexorable. The
king then directed all his attention to the prosecution of
his journey. Innocent promised to protect the kingdom
of France against the heretic Frederick and the king of
England; the latter of whom he always styled his vassal: he
witnessed without regret the departure of a prince venerated
for his love of justice, whose presence in Europe might be
an obstacle to his policy. The sovereign pontiff had not
much trouble in keeping his promise of defending the independence
and peace of France; for the discords he excited
in other states preserved that kingdom from all foreign
annoyance during the time of the crusade.</p>

<p>The fleet, which awaited Louis at Aigues-Mortes, was
composed of twenty-eight vessels, without reckoning those
that were to transport the horses and the provisions. The
king embarked, followed by his two brothers, Charles duke
of Anjou, and Robert count d’Artois, and the queen Marguerite,
who did not dread less the idea of remaining with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
her mother-in-law than that of living away from her husband.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>
Alphonse, count of Poictiers, deferred his departure
till the following year, and returned to Paris to assist the
queen regent with his counsels and authority. When the
whole army of the Crusaders was embarked, the signal was
given, the priests, according to the custom in maritime expeditions,
sang the <i>Veni Creator</i>, and the fleet set sail.</p>

<p>France had then no marine, the sailors and pilots were
almost all Spaniards or Italians. Two Genoese performed
the functions of commanders or admirals. A great part of
the barons and knights had never before seen the sea, and
everything they saw filled them with surprise and dread;
they invoked all the saints of Paradise, and recommended
their souls to God. The good Joinville does not at all dissemble
his fright, and cannot help saying: “A great fool is
he who, having any sin on his soul, places himself in such a
danger; for if he goes to sleep at night, he cannot be certain
he shall not find himself at the bottom of the sea in
the morning.”<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p>Louis IX. embarked at Aigues-Mortes, the 25th of
August, and arrived at Cyprus on the 21st of September.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>
Henry, grandson of Guy of Lusignan, who obtained the
kingdom of Cyprus in the third crusade, received the king
of France at Limisso, and conducted him to his capital of
Nicosia, amidst the acclamations of the people, nobility, and
clergy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span></p>

<p>A short time after the arrival of the Crusaders, it was
decided in a council, that the arms of the Christians should,
in the first place, be directed against Egypt. The reverses
that had been met with on the banks of the Nile, in preceding
wars, did not at all alarm the king of France and his
barons; it is even more than probable that Louis, before he
left his kingdom, had formed the design of carrying the war
into the country from which the Mussulmans drew their
wealth and their strength. The king of Cyprus, who had
recently received the title of king of Jerusalem from the
pope, the more strongly applauded, this determination, from
its giving him reason to hope to be delivered from the most
formidable of his neighbours, and the most cruel enemy of
the Christian colonies in Syria. This prince also caused a
crusade to be preached in his kingdom, for the sake of being
placed in a condition to accompany the French Crusaders,
and associate himself usefully in their conquests. He proposed
to the king of France and his barons to wait till he
had concluded his preparations. “The lords and prelates
of Cyprus,” says William of Nangis, “all took the cross,
appeared before Louis, and told him they would go with him
wherever it should please him to lead them, if he would
stay till the winter had passed away.” As Louis and the
principal French nobles appeared but little disposed to delay
their march, the Cypriots spared neither protestations of
friendship, caresses, nor prayers to detain them. Every day
was devoted to rejoicings and feastings, in which the nobility
and wealthy men of the kingdom exhibited the splendour of
eastern courts. The enchanting aspect of the isle, a country
rich in all the delicious productions of nature, particularly
that Cyprus wine which Solomon himself has not disdained
to celebrate, seconded in a powerful manner the
entreaties and seductions of the court of Nicosia. It was
decided that the Christian army should not depart before
the following spring.</p>

<p>It was not long before they became fully aware of the
error they had committed. Amidst the excessive abundance
that reigned in their camp, the Crusaders gave themselves
up to intemperance; in a country in which pagan fables
placed the altars of voluptuousness, the virtue of the pilgrims
was every day exposed to fresh trials; a protracted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
idleness relaxed the discipline of the army, and, to crown
these evils, a pestilential disease exercised great ravages
among the defenders of the cross. The pilgrims had to
lament the death of more than two hundred and fifty knights
from this calamity. Contemporary chronicles mention among
the lords and prelates that were victims to it, the counts of
Dreux and Vendôme, Robert, bishop of Beauvais, and the
brave William des Barres; the army had likewise to regret
the loss of the last of the race of the Archambault de Bourbons,
whose county became afterwards the heritage of the
children of Saint Louis, and gave to the royal family of
France a name that it has rendered for ever illustrious in
the annals of that country.</p>

<p>A great number of barons and knights were in want of
money to maintain their troops, and Louis freely opened his
treasury to them. The sieur de Joinville, who had no more
than one hundred and twenty livres tournois<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> left, received
from the monarch eight hundred livres; a considerable sum
in those days.</p>

<p>Many of the nobles complained of having sold their lands
and ruined themselves to follow the king to the crusade.
The liberality of Louis could not possibly satisfy all these
complainants. A great number of knights, after being
ruined by the abode in the isle of Cyprus, could not endure
the idleness they were condemned to, but were anxious to
set out for Syria or Egypt, hoping to make the Saracens pay
the expenses of the war. Louis had a great deal of trouble
to restrain them; historians agree in saying that he was
<i>only half obeyed</i>; therefore, he had much more frequent
occasion to exercise his patience and evangelical mildness
than his authority; and if he succeeded in appeasing all discords
and suppressing all murmurs, it was less by the ascendancy
of his power than by that of his virtue.</p>

<p>Differences arose between the Greek clergy and the Latin
clergy of the isle of Cyprus. Louis succeeded in putting
an end to them. The Templars and Hospitallers appealed
to him as judge in their constantly reviving quarrels; he
made them swear to be reconciled, and to have no other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
enemies than those of Christ. The Genoese and Pisans
resident at Ptolemaïs, had long and serious disputes, both
parties having recourse to arms, and nothing appeared able
to check the fury and scandal of a civil war in a Christian
city. The wise mediation of Louis reëstablished peace.
Aitho, king of Armenia, and Bohemond, prince of Antioch
and Tripoli, implacable enemies, both sent ambassadors to
the king of France: he induced them to conclude a truce:
thus Louis IX. appeared among the nations of the East as
an angel of peace and concord.</p>

<p>At this period the territory of Antioch was ravaged by
vagabond bands of Turcomans; Louis sent Bohemond five
hundred cross-bowmen. Aitho had just formed an alliance
with the Tartars, and was preparing to invade the states of
the sultan of Iconium in Asia Minor. As the Armenian
prince enjoyed a great reputation in the East for skill and
bravery, many French knights, impatient to display their
valour, left Cyprus for the purpose of joining his standard
and sharing the fruits of his victories. Joinville, after
having spoken of their departure, says nothing of their exploits,
and only informs us of their unhappy destiny by these
words: “not one of them ever came back.”<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<p>Fame had announced the arrival of Louis throughout all
the countries of the East, and the news produced a great
sensation among both Mussulmans and Christians. A prediction,
that was credited in the most distant regions, and
which missionaries found spread even through Persia,
announced that a king of the Franks was destined speedily
to disperse all infidels and deliver Asia from the sacrilegious
worship and laws of Mahomet. It was believed that the
time was now come for the accomplishment of this prediction.
A crowd of Christians hastened from Syria, Egypt,
and all the countries of the East, to salute him whom God
had sent to fulfil his divine promises.</p>

<p>It was at this period that Louis received an embassy that
excited the curiosity and attention of the Crusaders in
the highest degree; the marvellous account of it occupies a
conspicuous place in the chronicles of the middle ages.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>
This embassy came from a Tartar prince, named Ecalthaï,<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>
who professed himself to be converted to the Christian faith,
and displayed the most ardent zeal for the triumph of the
Gospel. The head of this deputation, named David, remitted
to the king a letter filled with sentiments expressed with so
much exaggeration as ought to have rendered it doubtful;
he said that the great khan had received baptism three years
before, and that he was prepared to assist the expedition of
the French Crusaders with all his power. The news of this
embassy soon spread through the army, and from that time
nothing was talked of but the promised succour of the great
khan or emperor of the Tartars; the leaders and soldiers
flocked to the residence of Louis to see the ambassador of
the prince Ecalthaï, whom they considered <i>as one of the
first barons of Tartary</i>.</p>

<p>The king of France interrogated the deputies several
times respecting their journey, their country, and the
character and disposition of their sovereign; and as all he
heard flattered his most cherished thoughts, he conceived no
mistrust, and discovered no signs of imposture in their replies.
The Tartar ambassadors were received at his court,
and admitted to his table; he himself conducted them to the
celebration of divine service in the metropolitan church of
Nicosia, where all the people were edified by their devotion.</p>

<p>At their departure, the king of France and the legate of
the pope charged them with several letters<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> for the prince
Ecalthaï and the great khan of the Tartars. To these letters
were added magnificent presents; among which was a scarlet
tent, upon which Louis had caused to be worked “The
Annunciation of the Virgin Mary, the Mother of God, and
all the other points of faith.” The king wrote to Queen
Blanche, as did the legate to the sovereign pontiff, to
announce the extraordinary embassy that had arrived from
the most distant regions of the East. The propitious news
of an alliance with the Tartars, who were then looked upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
as the most formidable of all nations, spread joy among the
people of the West, and increased their hopes of the success
of the crusade.</p>

<p>Missionaries that were sent into Tartary by Louis were
very soon satisfied that the conversion of the great khan was
nothing but a fable. The Mogul ambassadors had advanced
many other impostures in their accounts, which has induced
some learned moderns to think that this great embassy<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>
was nothing but a trick, the contrivance of which may be
attributed to some Armenian monks. However it may be,
there can be no doubt that the Moguls, who were at war
with the Mussulmans, might have some interest in conciliating
the Christians, and might be led, from that time, to
consider the Franks as useful auxiliaries.</p>

<p>Winter, in the mean time, was drawing towards an end,
and the period fixed upon for the departure of the French
Crusaders was approaching. The king of France ordered a
great number of flat-bottomed boats to be constructed, to
facilitate the descent of the Christian army upon the coast
of Egypt. As the Genoese fleet, in which the French had
embarked at Aigues-Mortes, had left the port of Lemisso,
it required considerable trouble to get together, from all
parts, vessels sufficient to transport the army and the numerous
magazines formed in the isle of Cyprus. Louis IX.
applied to the Genoese and Venetians established on the
coast of Syria, who, to the great scandal of the knights and
barons, showed, in this instance, more cupidity than devotion,
and placed an exorbitant price upon services demanded
of them in the name of Christ.</p>

<p>At this time Louis received a communication from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
emperor of Germany, still pursued by the thunders of Rome.
This prince sent provisions to the Crusaders, and expressed
great grief, in his letters, at being unable to share the perils
of the holy war. The king of France thanked Frederick,
and sighed at the obstinacy of the pope, which deprived the
defenders of the cross of such a powerful auxiliary.</p>

<p>Preparations were continued with the greatest activity;
every day fresh Crusaders arrived, who came from the ports
of the West, or had passed the winter in the isles of the
Archipelago, or on the coasts of Greece. All the nobility
of Cyprus had taken the cross, and were preparing for their
conflict with the infidels. The greatest harmony prevailed
between the two nations; in the Greek as well as the Latin
churches, prayers were offered up to Heaven for the success
of the Christian arms; and throughout the host nothing
was talked of but the wonders of the East, and the riches
of Egypt, which they were about to conquer.</p>

<p>Whilst enthusiasm and joy were thus exuberant among
the Christian warriors, the grand masters of St. John and
the Temple wrote to Louis IX., to consult him upon the
possibility of opening a negotiation with the sultan of Cairo.
The leaders of these two orders anxiously desired to break
the chains of their knights who were detained in captivity
since the defeat of Gaza; they did not otherwise partake
with the Crusaders their blind confidence in victory; experience
of other crusades had taught them that the warriors
of the West, at first very redoubtable, almost always began
their wars with splendour, but that afterwards, weakened by
discord, exhausted by the fatigues of a distant expedition,
and sometimes led away by their natural inconstancy, they
only thought of returning into Europe, abandoning the
Christian colonies to all the furies of an enemy irritated by
former defeats. According to these considerations, the two
grand masters would have wished to take advantage of the
powerful succours from the West, to conclude a useful and
durable peace. The mode of negotiation presented them
much greater future advantages than a war, whose chances
were doubtful, and whose perils might, in the end, all recoil
upon them.</p>

<p>Their pacific message arrived at the moment when nothing
way spoken of in the Christian army but the conquests they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
were about to make; when all minds were heated by the
enthusiasm of glory, and the hope of a rich booty. The
proposition alone of peace with the infidels was a true subject
of scandal for these warriors, who believed themselves
called upon to destroy, throughout the East, the domination
and the power of all the enemies of Christ. The general
surprise and indignation gave credence to the blackest calumnies
against the grand master of the Temple, who was
loudly accused of keeping up a secret intelligence with the
sultan of Cairo, and of having joined in barbarous ceremonies
to bind this impious union. Louis IX., who did not
come into the East to sign a treaty of peace and to deliver
only a few prisoners, shared the indignation of his companions
in arms, and forbade the grand masters of the Temple
and St. John to reiterate propositions insulting to the
Christian warriors, insulting to him.</p>

<p>The Crusaders, intoxicated with their future success, were
not aware of half the obstacles they were about to encounter;
they thought more about the wealth than the strength
of their enemies; acquainted with neither the climate nor
the country to which their wishes were directed, their ignorance
redoubled their security, and fed hopes that were
doomed soon to fade away.</p>

<p>The leaders of the crusade were particularly sanguine
with respect to the divisions of the Mussulman princes, who
were quarrelling for the provinces of Syria and Egypt: in
fact, since the death of Saladin, discord had rarely ceased to
trouble the family of the Ayoubites. But as their dissensions
broke out in civil wars, and as civil wars rendered the
population more warlike, their empire, which grew weaker
every day inwardly, often, consequently, became the stronger
outwardly; when common danger united the Mussulman
powers, or that one of those powers mastered the rest, everything
was to be dreaded from an empire always tottering in
peace, but which seemed to derive fresh strength from the
animosities and perils of a war against the Christians.</p>

<p>Malek Saleh Negmeddin, who then reigned in Egypt, was
the son of the sultan Camel, celebrated by the victory gained
at Mansourah over the army of John of Brienne and the
legate Pelagius. Driven from the throne by a conspiracy,
he endeavoured to recover it by arms; conquered, he fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
into the chains of his rival, and profited by the lessons of
adversity. Very soon, the esteem in which his abilities were
held; the hatred which the prince who reigned in his place
inspired; the want of change, and perhaps a certain partiality
for revolt and treason, recalled him to empire. The
new sovereign showed himself much more skilful and more
fortunate than his predecessors; he knew how to preserve
obedience in the provinces; to maintain discipline in his
army; and to keep fear alive among his enemies. He had
taken advantage of the arms of the Carismians to get possession
of Damascus, and to crush both the Christians and
their allies. From this period Negmeddin extended his
conquests upon the banks of the Euphrates, and at length
gathered under his laws the greater part of the empire of
Saladin.</p>

<p>At the moment Louis IX. landed in the isle of Cyprus,
the sultan of Cairo was in Syria, where he was making war
against the prince of Aleppo, and held the city of Emessa in
siege. He was acquainted with all the projects of the
Christians, and gave orders for the defence of all the avenues
of Egypt. When he learnt that the Christian army was
about to embark, he immediately abandoned the siege of
Emessa, and concluded a truce with enemies of whom he
entertained very little dread, to return to his states that
were threatened with invasion.</p>

<p>The Orientals considered the French as the bravest people
of the race of the Franks, and the king of France as the
most redoubtable monarch of the West. The preparations
of Negmeddin were commensurate with the dread these new
enemies naturally inspired. He neglected nothing in fortifying
the coasts or in provisioning Damietta, which was
most likely to be the object of the first hostilities. A
numerous fleet was equipped, descended the Nile, and was
placed at the mouth of the river; an army, commanded by
Fakreddin, the most skilful of the emirs, encamped on the
coast, to the west of the mouth of the river, at the very
same point where, thirty-three years before, the army of
John of Brienne had landed.</p>

<p>All these preparations would, no doubt, have been sufficient
to meet the first attacks of the Crusaders, if the sultan
of Cairo had been able to direct them himself, and command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
his troops in person; but he was attacked by a disease which
his physicians pronounced to be mortal. In a state of
things in which everything depended upon the presence and
life of the prince, the certainty of his approaching end
necessarily weakened confidence and zeal, cooled the general
courage, and was injurious to the execution of all the measures
taken for the defence of the country.</p>

<p>Such was the military and political situation of Egypt at
the time Louis embarked from the ports of the isle of
Cyprus. Many historians say, that before his departure,
according to the custom of chivalry, he sent a herald-at-arms
to the sultan Negmeddin, to declare war against him. In
the early crusades, many Christian princes had in this manner
addressed chivalric messages to the Mussulman powers they
were about to attack: it is quite possible that Louis might
imitate this example; but the letter attributed to him bears
no character of truth about it. The same historians add,
that the sultan of Cairo could not refrain from tears on
reading the letter of St. Louis. His reply, quoted in Makrisy,
is at least conformable to his known character, and to
the spirit of the Mussulman princes. He affected to brave
the unexpected threats and attacks of the disciples of
Christ; he referred with pride to the victories of the Mussulmans
over the Christians; and whilst reproaching the
king of France with the injustice of his aggressions, he
quoted in his letter this passage from the Koran:&mdash;“They
who fight unjustly shall perish.”</p>

<p>This message contained predictions that were but too
fully realized in the end. There is nothing, however, to lead
us to believe that any correspondence was then established
between Louis and the sultan of Cairo. Prudence, at least,
required the king of France to send messengers and emissaries
into Egypt, to reconnoitre the state, strength, and
resources of the country. It is more than probable, that in
preceding crusades it was not only in obedience to the spirit
of chivalry, but to ascertain the position of their enemies
that ambassadors were sent; we must confess, however, that
we cannot find in any chronicle of the times evidence of
their having taken any precaution of this kind. A foresight
which might bear the slightest association with timidity,
stratagem, or even policy, was not the least in accordance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
with the character of Louis and his knights. History has
no hesitation in affirming that the Crusaders, ready at this
period to embark for Egypt, knew nothing of the countries
into which they were about to carry their arms, but that
which they had learnt from the uncertain accounts of common
report.</p>

<p>The signal of departure was given on the Friday before
Pentecost; and a numerous fleet, in which embarked the
French army and the warriors of the isle of Cyprus,<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> sailed
gallantly out from the port of Limisso. “This was a thing
most beautiful to behold,” says Joinville; “for it appeared
as if the sea, as far as the eye could reach, was covered with
the sails of vessels, which were to the number of eight hundred,
as well large as small.” All at once a wind blowing full
from the coast of Egypt gave rise to a violent storm, which
dispersed all the fleet; and Louis IX., who was forced to
put back to port, found, with great grief, that at least the
half of his vessels had been carried by the wind on to the
coasts of Syria. At this moment of disappointment, however,
unexpected reinforcements arrived, which restored the
hopes of Louis and his captains. These consisted of the
duke of Burgundy, who had passed the winter in the Morea;
William of Salisbury, at the head of two hundred English
knights; and William of Villehardouin, prince of Achaia,
who forgot the dangers of the Latin empire of Constantinople
to go and fight the infidels on the banks of the Nile
and the Jordan. Without waiting for the vessels which the
tempest had dispersed, they again set sail, and the fleet, with
a favourable wind, directed its course towards Egypt. On
the fourth day, at sunrise, the watch on deck cried, “Land!
land!” A sailor, who served as pilot, ascended to the round
top of the leading vessel, and such was the sentiment which
the sight of the land inhabited by the infidels inspired in the
Christians, that this man cried out, “We have nothing to
do but to recommend ourselves to God; for here we are,
before Damietta.” These words flew from rank to rank, and
the whole fleet drew as near as they could to the vessel of
Louis IX. The principal leaders endeavoured to get on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
board of it; the king awaited them in a warlike attitude
and exhorted them to offer thanks to God for having brought
them face to face with the enemies of Jesus Christ. As the
greater part of the leaders seemed to fear his life would be
too much exposed in the course of a war which must be
terrible: “Follow my example,” said he to them; “leave me
to brave all perils, and in the midst of the hottest fight never
once think that the safety of the state and the Church resides
in my person; you yourselves are the state and the
Church, and you ought to see in me nothing but a man
whose life, like that of any other, may be dissipated like a
shadow, when it shall please the God for whom we combat.”
Thus Louis forgot himself and his state, and before the
infidels, the king of France was but a simple soldier of Jesus
Christ.</p>

<p>This discourse animated the courage of the barons and
knights; orders were given for the whole fleet to prepare
for action. In every vessel the warriors embraced each
other with joy at the approach of peril; such as quarrels
had alienated, swore to forget all divisions and injuries, and
to conquer or to die together. Joinville says he forced two
knights, who had been irreconcilable enemies, to make
peace, by persuading them that their discord might draw
down the maledictions of Heaven, and that union among
the Christian soldiers could alone open to them the road to
Egypt.</p>

<p>Whilst the Crusaders were thus preparing, the Mussulmans
neglected nothing for their defence; their sentinels
had perceived the Christian fleet, from the walls of Damietta,
and the news was soon spread through the city; a bell,
which had remained in the great mosque since the conquest
of John of Brienne, gave the signal of danger, and was
heard on both sides of the river. Four Mussulman galleys
advanced to reconnoitre the strength of the Crusaders;
three of them were sunk, and the fourth, getting back with
great difficulty to the Nile, announced to the infidels what
enemies they had to contend with.</p>

<p>In the mean time the Christian fleet advanced in order of
battle, and cast anchor within a quarter of a league of the
coast, at the moment at which the sun had performed half
his daily course. The shore and sea presented the most imposing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
spectacle; the coast of Egypt was <i>lined with all the
powers of the soldan, who were people goodly to look upon</i>.
The sea appeared to be covered with ships, over which
floated the banners of the cross. The Mussulman fleet,
laden with soldiers and machines of war, defended the
entrance of the Nile. Fakreddin, the leader of the infidel
army, appeared amidst their ranks in a panoply so splendid,
that Joinville, in his surprise, compares him to the sun.
The heavens and the earth resounded with the noise of the
bended horns and the naccaires,<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> a kind of enormous kettledrum,
a thing very frightful to hear, and very strange to the
French.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<p>All the leaders assembled in council in the king’s vessel;
some proposed to defer the descent till the vessels which
had been dispersed by the tempest should rejoin them: “To
attack the infidels without having all their forces, would be
to give them an advantage that might greatly elevate their
pride; and even if success were certain, it appeared but just
to wait, that all the Crusaders might have their share of the
glory they came so far to seek.” Some went still further,
and spoke of the embarrassments and perils of a descent in
an unknown country; of the disorders which must accompany
a first attack; and of the difficulty of rallying the army
and fleet, if the obstacles they met with should prove invincible.
Louis IX. did not at all agree with this opinion:
“We have not come thus far,” he said, “to listen coolly to
the menaces and insults of our enemies, or to remain, during
several days motionless spectators of their preparations.
To temporize is to raise their courage, and weaken the
ardour of the French warriors. We have neither road nor
port, in which we can shelter ourselves from the winds, or
from the unexpected attacks of the Saracens; a second
tempest may again disperse what remains of our fleet, and
deprive us of all means of beginning the war with a chance
of success. To-day God offers us victory; later he will
punish us for having neglected the opportunity to conquer.”</p>

<p>The majority of the leaders were of the opinion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
Louis IX., and it was resolved that the descent should be
made on the morrow. A strict watch was preserved during
the night; a vast number of flambeaux were kept burning,
and vessels were placed near the mouth of the Nile, to
observe the motions of the Saracens.</p>

<p>At daybreak the whole fleet weighed anchor, and the
Mussulmans at the same time got under arms. Their infantry
and cavalry occupied the entire shore of the point at
which they expected the Crusaders to land.</p>

<p>When the vessels drew near the shore, the Christian warriors
got into the barks that accompanied the fleet, and
ranged themselves in two lines. Louis IX., accompanied
by the two princes his brothers, and his chosen knights,
placed himself at the right point. The cardinal legate, bearing
the cross of the Saviour, was on his right hand, and in a
bark in front of him floated the oriflamme of France.</p>

<p>The count of Jaffa, of the illustrious family of Brienne,
was at the left point towards the mouth of the Nile; he appeared
at the head of the knights from the isle of Cyprus
and the barons of Palestine. He was on board the lightest
bark of the fleet. This boat bore the arms of the counts of
Jaffa, painted on its poop and prow. Around his standard
floated banderoles of a thousand colours, and three hundred
rowers impelled the vessel through the waves like the flight
of the swallow over the stream. Erard of Brienne, surrounded
by a chosen troop, occupied the centre of the line,
with Baldwin of Rheims, who commanded a thousand warriors.
The knights and barons stood erect in their boats, looking
earnestly at the shore, lance in hand, with their horses beside
them. In the front and on the wings of the army, a crowd
of crossbow-men were placed to keep off the enemy.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></p>

<p>As soon as they were within bow-shot, a shower of stones,
arrows, and javelins was poured at the same instant from the
shore and from the line of the Crusaders. The ranks of the
Christians appeared for a moment shaken. The king commanded
the rowers to redouble their efforts to gain the
shore. He himself set the first example; in spite of the
legate, who endeavoured to restrain him, he plunged into
the waves, in full armour, his buckler over his breast, and
his sword in hand; the water being up to his shoulders: the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
whole Christian army, after the example of the king, cast
themselves into the sea, crying, “<i>Montjoie! St. Denis!</i>” This
multitude of men and horses, endeavouring to gain the shore,
elevated the waves which broke at the feet of the Saracens;
the warriors pressed on, clashing against each other in their
progress&mdash;nothing was heard but the noise of the waves and
the oars, the cries of the soldiers and the sailors, and the
tumultuous shock of the barks and vessels, which advanced
in disorder.</p>

<p>The Mussulman battalions assembled on the shore could
not stop the French warriors. Joinville and Baldwin of
Rheims landed the first; after them came the count of Jaffa.
They were drawing up in order of battle, when the cavalry
of the Saracens came pouring down upon them; the Crusaders
closed in their ranks, covered themselves with their
bucklers, and presenting the points of their lances, checked
the impetuosity of the enemy. All their companions who
had reached the shore, immediately formed in rear of this
battalion.</p>

<p>Already the oriflamme was planted on the shore; Louis
had landed. Without giving the least reflection to the danger,
he immediately fell on his knees to offer up his thanks
to Heaven; and springing up again, filled with fresh ardour,
called his bravest knights around him. An Arab historian
relates that the king of the Franks then caused his tent to
be pitched, which was of a bright scarlet, and attracted all
eyes. At length, all the army being landed, a sanguinary
contest began on every part of the coast; the Saracens and
Franks, seeking and attacking each other, formed one conflicting
mass. Nobody remained inactive; the two fleets
quickly became engaged at the mouth of the Nile. Whilst
the shore and the sea resounded thus with the shock of arms,
Queen Marguerite and the duchess of Anjou, who remained
on board a vessel at a distance, awaited in terrible anxiety
the issue of the double battle; they offered up fervent
prayers, and pious ecclesiastics assembled around them,
joined in holy psalms to obtain the protection of the God of
armies.</p>

<p>The fleet of the Saracens was soon dispersed; many of
the vessels were sunk, the remainder escaped up the river.
In the mean time, the troops of Fakreddin, broken in all
directions, retired in the greatest confusion; the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
pursuing them up to their intrenchments. After a last
desperate struggle, the Mussulmans abandoned their camp
and the western bank of the Nile, leaving several of their
emirs on the field of battle: nothing could resist the French,
animated by the presence and the example of their king.</p>

<p>In the course of the battle several messenger pigeons had
been sent to the sultan of Cairo, whose malady confined him
in a small town situated between Damietta and Mansourah:
as no answer was received, a report of his death began to
prevail, and completed the discouragement of the Egyptian
troops. Many of the emirs were impatient to know, and at
the same time were doubtful of the fate that awaited them
under a new reign. Several deserted their standards, and
by that means augmented the disorder: towards evening
the whole army dispersed, and the soldiers, abandoned by
their leaders, thought of nothing but seeking safety in
flight.<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> The Crusaders remained masters of the coast and
of both banks of the Nile; and this glorious victory had
cost but little Christian blood, for only two or three knights
were killed: of the French nobles the army had only to
deplore the count de la Marche, who appeared to seek death,
and, dying thus by the side of his king, expiated, say our
historians, his numerous treasons and crimes.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the day, the tents were pitched on the
field of battle; the clergy chanted the <i>Te Deum</i>, and the
night was passed in rejoicings. Whilst the victorious army
was thus giving itself up to exultation, the greatest confusion
reigned in Damietta; the fugitives had passed through
the city, spreading, as they went, the contagion of the fear
that pursued them. Fakreddin himself gave no orders for
the security of the place: the inhabitants expected every
instant to see the French enter; some dreaded a surprise,
others feared a siege; there was no one to reassure them,
and the darkness of night came on to complete their terror
and confusion. Fear rendered them barbarous; they pitilessly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
massacred all the Christians that were in the city; the
troops, on retiring, pillaged the houses and set fire to the
public edifices; whole families abandoned their homes, carrying
with them their furniture and movable wealth. The
garrison was composed of the bravest of the Arab tribe of
the Benou-Kenaneh;<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> but fear gained dominion over them
as well as the rest; they abandoned the towers and the
ramparts intrusted to their guardianship, and fled away
with the army of Fakreddin. Before the dawn of day, the
city was without defenders, and almost without inhabitants.</p>

<p>The columns of flame that arose from the bosom of the
city were soon observed in the Christian camp; the whole
horizon was on fire. On the morrow, at daybreak, the soldiers
advanced towards the city, all the gates of which they
found open. They met with nothing in the streets but the
carcasses of the victims immolated by the despair and fanaticism
of the infidels, and a few living Christians, who,
having contrived to conceal themselves from the murderers
and executioners, had, in their turn, massacred all the
Mussulmans whom age and infirmities prevented from flying
with their compatriots. The soldiers returned to announce
what they had seen, and could scarcely gain credit from
their companions. The army advanced cautiously in order
of battle. When they were assured that the city was
deserted, the Crusaders took possession of it. They employed
themselves, in the first place, to stop the progress of
the flames; then the soldiers spread themselves throughout
the city, for the purpose of pillaging it, and all that escaped
the conflagration became the reward of victory.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the king of France, the pope’s legate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
and the patriarch of Jerusalem, followed by a crowd of prelates
and ecclesiastics, entered Damietta in procession, and
repaired to the great mosque, which was once more converted
into a church, and consecrated to the Holy Virgin, the
mother of Jesus Christ. The French monarch, the clergy,
and all the leaders of the army, marched with heads uncovered
and barefooted, singing psalms of thanksgiving,
and attributing to God all the glory of this miraculous
conquest.</p>

<p>The news of this victory was soon spread through all the
Egyptian provinces. The continuator of Tabary, who was
then at Cairo, informs us in his History, that this event was
considered as one of the greatest calamities. All Mussulmans
were sunk in despondency and fear; the most brave
even despaired of being able to save Egypt.</p>

<p>Negmeddin was still ill, and unable to mount on horseback;
the defeat of his army, and the victory of the
Christians, were announced to him by the soldiers and
inhabitants that had fled from Damietta. He broke into a
violent rage against the garrison, and pronounced a sentence
of instant death upon fifty-four of the most guilty: in vain
they alleged the retreat of the emir Fakreddin as an excuse;
the sultan said they merited death for having feared the arms
of their enemies more than the anger of their master. One
of these, condemned to suffer with his son, a young man of
singular beauty, implored the sultan to allow him to die
first; the sultan refused even this grace, and the unhappy
father underwent the agony of seeing his son killed before
his eyes, ere he himself was handed over to the executioner.
When we reflect upon the barbarity of these executions, we
are astonished that a prince without an army should find
instruments to execute his wrath, or even that he should
dare to display it in this frightful manner upon deserters
and cowards; but this public and awful exhibition of punishment,
which kept up the belief in the power of the master,
acted strongly upon the minds of the multitude, and assisted
in bringing back the vulgar crowd of the Mussulman soldiery
to discipline and order. But it was not thus with the
principal emirs; already but little disposed to tremble before
a sovereign whom they regarded as their own work, and who
stood in such need of their support. The sultan would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
willingly have punished Fakreddin, but the circumstances,
says an Arabian historian, dictated patience. He contented
himself with addressing a few reproaches to him. “The
presence of these Franks,” said he to him, “must have
something very terrible in it, since men like you cannot
support it during one whole day.” These words created
more indignation than fear among the emirs that were
present, and some of them looked at Fakreddin, as if to tell
him they were ready to sacrifice the sultan; but the print of
the cold hand of death was on the brow of the sultan, and
the sight of a dying man took away the wish to commit a
useless crime:&mdash;deplorable situation of a prince who had
within a few leagues of him a formidable enemy, that he was
not able to contend with; near him traitors, that he did not
dare to punish; and who, whilst seeing his authority every
day diminish, and feeling himself hourly dying, appeared
to have no salvation to expect for either himself or his
empire!</p>

<p>During this time the Crusaders established themselves in
Damietta without obstacle; Queen Marguerite and the
other princesses, with the legate and the clergy, occupied
the palaces and principal houses; the rest of the city was
abandoned to the pilgrims who did not bear arms: the
towers and ramparts were guarded by five hundred knights,
and the Christian army was encamped upon the plain on the
banks of the Nile. In this situation the Crusaders only
thought of enjoying the fruits of their victory in peace, and
appeared to have forgotten that they had still enemies to
contend with.</p>

<p>The sultan of Cairo had caused himself to be transported
to Mansourah, where he endeavoured to rally his army, and
re-establish discipline among the troops. Whether he had
recovered from his terror, or that he was willing to conceal
his alarm and the progress of his malady, he sent several
messages to Louis IX. In one of these letters, Negmeddin,
joining menaces to irony, congratulated the king of France
upon his arrival in Egypt, and asked him at what period it
would please him to depart again. The Mussulman prince
added, among other things, that the quantity of provisions
and agricultural instruments with which the Crusaders had
burdened their vessels, appeared to him to be a useless precaution;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
and to perform the duties of hospitality towards
the Franks, in a manner worthy of himself and them, he
engaged to supply them with corn during their sojourn in
his states. Negmeddin, in another message, offered the king
of France a general battle on the 25th day of June, in a
place that should be determined upon. Louis IX. answered
the first letter of the sultan by saying that he had landed in
Egypt on the day he had appointed, and as to the day of his
departure, he should think about it at leisure. With regard
to the proposed battle, the king contented himself with
replying, that he would neither accept the day nor choose
the place, because all days and all places were equally fit for
fighting with infidels. The French monarch added, that he
would attack the sultan wherever he should meet with him;
that he would pursue him at all times and without intermission;
and would treat him as an enemy till God had
touched his heart, and Christians might consider him as a
brother.</p>

<p>Fortune presented King Louis with an opportunity and
the means of accomplishing his threats. The Crusaders, whom
the tempest had separated from the fleet, continued to
arrive every day, and the knights of the Temple and of
St. John, who had been accused of being anxious for peace,
joined the banners of the army, and breathed nothing but
war. They were acquainted with the country, and with the
best manner of combating the infidels; and with this useful
reinforcement, the king was able to undertake an expedition
against Alexandria, or, by obtaining possession of Mansourah,
render himself master of the route to Cairo. After the taking
of Damietta, several of the leaders had proposed to pursue
the Mussulmans, and take advantage of the terror that the
first victory of the Christians had inspired. But the period
was approaching at which the waters of the Nile began to
rise, and the remembrance of the overthrow of Pelagius and
John of Brienne, dispelled the idea of marching against the
capital of Egypt. Before he pursued his conquests, Louis
wished to wait the arrival of his brother, the count of Poictiers,
who was to embark with the <i>arrière</i> ban of the kingdom
of France. Most historians view in this delay the cause of
all the evils that afterwards befell the Crusaders. We have
nothing like sufficient positive documents to test the truth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
of their opinion; but we may say with certainty, that the
inaction of the Christian army became, from that time, a
source of most fatal disorders.</p>

<p>These disorders began to break out when the division took
place of the booty made at the taking of Damietta. To animate
the courage of the Crusaders, the treasures of this
city, the entrepôt of the merchandises of the East, had often
been boasted of; but as the richest quarters had been destroyed
by the conflagration, and as the inhabitants had,
when they fled, taken their most valuable effects with them,
the spoils were very far from answering the hopes of the
victorious army. In spite of the threats of the legate, several
of the Crusaders had not brought all that fell into their
hands to the common stock. The whole of the booty obtained
in the city only produced the sum of six thousand
<i>livres tournois</i>,<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> to be divided among the Crusaders, whose
surprise and indignation found vent in violent murmurs.</p>

<p>As it had been determined that no division should be
made of the provisions, but that they should be preserved in
the royal magazines, for the support of the army, this resolution,
so contrary to ancient usages, gave birth to loud
complaints. Joinville informs us that the <i>prud’homme</i> John
of Valery, whose stern probity and bravery were the admiration
of the whole army, addressed some warm representations
to the king on this subject. John of Valery alleged
the laws of the Holy Land, and the custom pursued till that
time in the crusades; he mentioned the example of John of
Brienne, who, at the first conquest of Damietta, had only
retained one-third of the riches and provisions found in the
city, abandoning the rest to the general army. This custom
was even less consecrated by the holy wars than by the
feudal laws, according to which every lord carried on the war
at his own expense, and by right had a share in all the plunder
obtained from the enemy. But it might be objected, that
Louis IX. furnished most of the leaders of the army with
money, and by that the counts and barons had renounced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
the conditions of the feudal compact. This law of the division
of provisions, which had, in fact, been observed in
preceding crusades, sufficiently accounts for the scarcity
that had so often desolated the Christian armies. The pious
monarch was anxious to avoid evils that were the fruit of
want of prudence and foresight, and refused to listen to the
complaints of most of the French nobles. Thus, says Joinville,
scarcity continued, and made the people very much
dissatisfied.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>

<p>This spirit of dissatisfaction was quickly joined by other
disorders, the consequences of which were still more deplorable.
The knights forgot, in their fatal inactivity, both
their warlike virtues and the object of the holy war. The
riches of Egypt and the East being promised to them, the
lords and barons made haste to consume, in festivities and
pleasures, the money which they had obtained from the liberality
of the king, or by the sale of their lands and castles.
The passion for gaming had got entire possession of both
leaders and soldiers; after losing their fortune, they risked
even their horses and arms. Even beneath the shadow of
the standards of Christ, the Crusaders gave themselves up
to all the excesses of debauchery; the contagion of the most
odious vices pervaded all ranks, and places of prostitution
were found even in the close vicinity of the pavilion inhabited
by the pious monarch of the French.</p>

<p>To satisfy the boundless taste for luxury and pleasure,
recourse was had to all sorts of violent means. The leaders
of the army pillaged the traders that provisioned the camp
and the city; they imposed enormous tributes upon them,
and this assisted greatly in bringing on scarcity. The most
ardent made distant excursions, surprised caravans, devastated
towns and plains, and bore away Mussulman women,
whom they brought in triumph to Damietta. The sharing
even of this sort of booty often gave rise to angry quarrels, and
the whole camp resounded with complaints, threats, and
confusion.</p>

<p>One of the most afflicting phases of this picture was, that
the authority of the king became less respected daily; as
corruption increased, the habits of obedience declined; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
laws were without power, and virtue had no longer any
empire. Louis IX. met with opposition to his wishes, even
from the princes of his own family. The count d’Artois,
a young, ardent, and presumptuous prince, unable to endure
either rivalry or contradiction, proud of his military
renown, and jealous to excess of that of others, was in the
habit of constantly provoking the other leaders, and of
heaping upon them, without motive, the most outrageous
affronts. The earl of Salisbury, to whom he had behaved
very ill, complained of him to Louis, and being unable to
obtain the satisfaction he demanded, in his anger pronounced
those memorable words: “<i>You are then not a king,
if you are unable to administer justice.</i>” This indocility of
the princes, and the licentiousness of the great, completed
the disorder; every day relaxation of discipline was observed
to increase; the guarding of the camp, which extended far
over the plains and along the banks of the Nile, was scarcely
attended to; the advanced posts of the Christian army were
constantly exposed to the attacks of the enemy, without
being able to oppose any other means of resistance than
imprudent and rash bravery, which only increased the
danger.</p>

<p>Among the Mussulman soldiers sent to harass the Crusaders,
the most successful in their mission were the Bedouin
Arabs; intrepid warriors, indefatigable horsemen, having no
other country but the desert, no other property but their
horses and arms, the hopes of plunder supported them through
all toils, and taught them to brave all dangers. With the
Arabs of the desert were joined some Carismian horsemen,
who had escaped from the ruin of their warlike nation.
Accustomed to live by brigandage, both these watched night
and day, to dog the Christian soldiers, and appeared to
possess the instinct and activity of those wild animals that
prowl constantly around the dwellings of man in search of
their prey. The sultan of Cairo promised a golden byzant
for every Christian head that should be brought into his
camp; sometimes the Arabs and Carismians surprised the
Crusaders who wandered from the army, and often took advantage
of the darkness of night to get access to the camp;
sentinels asleep on their posts, knights in bed in their tents,
were struck by invisible hands, and when day appeared to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
lighten the scene of carnage, the barbarians fled along the
banks of the Nile, to demand their wages of the sultan of
Egypt.</p>

<p>These surprises and nocturnal attacks had a considerable
effect in reanimating the courage of the Mussulmans. To
raise the confidence of the multitude and the army, great
care was taken to exhibit the heads of the Christians; all
captives were paraded about in triumph, and the least advantage
obtained over the Franks was celebrated throughout
Egypt. Contemporary historians, led away by common
exaggeration, talk of the most trifling combats as memorable
victories; and we are astonished, at the present day, to read
in the history of a period so abounding in great military
events, that in the month of Ramadan thirty-seven Christians
were brought in chains to Cairo, that they were
followed, some days afterwards, by thirty-eight other captives,
among whom were distinguished five knights. The
activity of Negmeddin appeared to increase as his end approached.
He employed the greatest exertions to get together
all his troops; was indefatigably attentive in watching
the movements of the Crusaders, and seldom failed to take
advantage of their errors. Men were employed night and
day in repairing the towers and fortifications of Mansourah;
the Mussulman fleet, which had ascended the Nile, cast
anchor immediately in front of the city. Whilst these preparations
were going on, news arrived that the garrison of
Damascus had taken possession of the city of Sidon, belonging
to the Franks, and that the important place of Carac
had just declared in favour of Negmeddin. This unexpected
intelligence, the sight of the prisoners, but above all, the inactivity
of the Christian army, which was attributed to fear,
completed the dissipation of the terror of the Mussulmans.
Whilst new reinforcements were every day arriving in the
camp of the sultan, the people flocked in crowds to the
mosques of Cairo and the other cities of Egypt, to invoke
the protection of Heaven, and return thanks to the God of
Mahomet, for having prevented the Christians from taking
advantage of their victories.</p>

<h2 class="p4">BOOK XIV.</h2>

<p class="pc">&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="pc lmid">A.D. 1248-1255.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Whilst</span> the Christian army was forgetting in its sojourn
at Damietta both the laws of discipline and the object of
the holy war, Alphonse, count of Poictiers, prepared to set
out for the East. All the churches of France still resounded
with pathetic exhortations addressed to the Christian warriors;
the bishops, in the name of the sovereign pontiff,
conjured the faithful to second, by means of charity, the
enterprise against the Saracens; an apostolic brief, granted
to the brother of the king not only the tribute imposed
upon the Crusaders who repurchased their vow, but all the
sums destined by testament to acts of piety, the object of
which was not distinctly signified. These sums must have
been considerable, but could scarcely suffice for the expenses
of an expedition which bore the appearance of another
crusade. The knights and barons who had not been affected
by the example of Louis IX. showed but very little enthusiasm,
or else wanted money for so long a voyage. Piety
and the love of glory were not powerful enough to seduce
them to join the banners of the holy war. History has preserved
an agreement, by which Hugh Lebrun, count of
Angoulême, consented to set out for the crusade with twelve
knights, but on the express condition that the count of
Poictiers should feed them at his own table during the expedition;
that he would advance the seigneur Hugh Lebrun
the sum of four thousand livres; and should pay him, in
perpetuity, a pension of six hundred livres tournois. This
agreement and several other similar ones were innovations
in the military usages of feudalism, and even in the usages
consecrated by the holy wars.</p>

<p>The English nobles, however, were impatient to follow
the example set them by Louis IX. We read in Matthew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
Paris, that the English lords and knights had already sold
or empawned their lands, and placed themselves entirely at
the mercy of the Jews; which appeared to be the preliminary
of a departure for the Holy Land. It is not out
of place to add here, that this impatience to set out for the
East, arose less from a religious motive than from the spirit
of opposition that animated the barons against their monarch,
Henry III., who was accused of being desirous of taking
advantage of the absence of Louis IX., and did all in his
power to retain the barons and lords of his kingdom; and as
the latter resisted his solicitations with contempt, he resolved
to employ the influence of the Church; “so that,” says
Matthew Paris, “like a young child who, having been ill-used,
goes to its mother to complain, the king of England
carried his complaints to the sovereign pontiff, adding that
he proposed to go himself, and lead his barons shortly to the
Holy Land.” The pope, in his replies, forbade Henry III.
to undertake anything against the kingdom of France; but,
at the same time, he threatened with the thunders of the
Church, all the knights and barons that should leave the
kingdom against the will of the king. Henry, supported by
the authority of the pope, ordered the commanders at Dover
and the other ports to take measures that no Crusader
should embark. Thus the court of Rome on one side
preached the crusade, and on the other prevented the departure
of the soldiers of the cross; which must have
tended to dissipate all the illusions and annihilate the spirit
of the holy war.</p>

<p>Baymoud, count of Thoulouse, had likewise taken the
oath to combat the infidels; but the inconstancy of his
character, and the policy of the pope, soon led him into
other enterprises. His age had seen him, by turns, full of
zeal for the Church, ardent to persecute it; the apostle of
heresy, and the terror of heretics: sometimes abandoned to
the furies of revolt, sometimes submissive to servitude;
braving the thunders of the court of Rome, afterwards
seeking the favour of the pontiffs; pursued by unjust wars,
and himself declaring war without a motive. At the epoch
of which we are speaking, the count of Thoulouse had given
up all idea of fighting against the infidels, and was preparing
to minister to the personal vengeance of Innocent IV., by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
turning his arms against Thomas of Savoy, who had recently
married a daughter of the emperor Frederick, in opposition
to the commands of the pope. He had already received the
money necessary for his preparations from the pope, and had
taken leave of his daughter, the countess of Poictiers, about
to depart for the East, when he fell sick at Milan. From
that time all the projects of his ambition faded away, and,
to borrow the expression of a modern historian, <i>he went into
another world to learn the result of the incomprehensible
varieties of his life</i>.</p>

<p>With him the illustrious house of Thoulouse became
extinct, a house of which several of the princes had been
heroes of the holy wars, others deplorable victims of crusades.
The county of Thoulouse thus became a property of the
family of the king of France, and whilst Louis IX. was
dissipating his armies and his treasures in vain endeavours
to make conquests in the East, conquests less brilliant, but
also less expensive, more useful and more durable, were increasing
the power of the monarchy and extending the limits
of the kingdom.</p>

<p>Germany, Holland, and Italy, filled with troubles, at that
time occupied all the attention of Frederick II., and did not
allow him to turn his thoughts towards the East. He sent
the count of Poictiers fifty horses and a quantity of provisions,
delighted, as he said, to seize an opportunity of
acquitting some of the obligations he had received from
France; he put up prayers for the success of the crusade,
and deeply regretted his inability to take a part in it.
Frederick had lived as the count of Thoulouse had done,
and like him, he was soon, in another world, to behold the
end of his ambition, of the inconstancy of his designs, and
of the vicissitudes of fortune.</p>

<p>Although the count of Poictiers was little favoured by
circumstances, he finished his preparations and got together
an army. The new Crusaders embarked at Aigues-Mortes,
at the moment the news of the taking of Damietta arrived
in the West. The Christian army expected them in Egypt
with greater anxiety, from the circumstance of the Sea of
Damietta having been, for more than a month, agitated, unceasingly,
by a furious tempest. Three weeks before their
arrival, all the pilgrims had put up prayers on their account;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
on the Saturday of each week they went in procession to the
seashore, to implore the protection of Heaven in favour of
the warriors about to join the Christian army. At length,
after a passage of two months, the count of Poictiers disembarked
before Damietta, His arrival not only diffused joy
and hope among the Crusaders, but permitted them to leave
their long and fatal state of inactivity.</p>

<p>Louis IX. assembled the council of the princes and barons,
to consult them on the line of march most advisable to be
taken, and upon measures for perfecting the conquest of
Egypt. Several of the leaders proposed to lay siege to
Alexandria: they represented that that city had a commodious
port; that the Christian fleet would there find
certain shelter; and that they could there procure munitions
and provisions with great facility: this was the opinion of
all that had experience in war. The headstrong youth of
the army, persuaded that they had sacrificed sufficiently to
prudence, by remaining several months in idleness, maintained
that they ought to proceed immediately against Cairo;
they thought nothing of the dangers the Christian army
must encounter in an unknown country, where they must
expect to meet with enemies irritated by fanaticism and
despair. The count d’Artois put himself particularly forward
among those who wished them to attack the capital of
Egypt. “When you wish to kill the serpent,” cried he, “you
ought always first to endeavour to crush his head.” This
opinion, expressed with warmth, prevailed in the council;
Louis himself partook of the ardour and hopes of short-sighted
youth, and the order was given for marching towards
Cairo.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p>The army of the Crusaders consisted of sixty thousand
fighting men, more than twenty thousand of whom were
horse. A numerous fleet ascended the Nile, laden with provisions,
baggage, and machines of war. Queen Marguerite,
with the countesses of Artois, Anjou, and Poictiers, remained
at Damietta, where the king had left a garrison under the
command of Olivier de Thermes.</p>

<p>The Crusaders encamped at Pharescour the 7th of December;
terror had preceded their triumphant march, and every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
thing seemed to favour their enterprise. One circumstance,
of which they were ignorant, would have increased the
security and joy of the Christian knights if they had known
of it; Negmeddin, after having struggled for a long time
against a cruel malady, was at length dead. This death
might have produced serious trouble in both the Egyptian
nation and army, if it had not been carefully concealed for
several days. After the sultan had breathed his last, the
Mamelukes guarded the gates of his palace as if he had been
still living; prayers were put up, and orders were issued in
his name: with the Mussulmans, nothing interrupted the
preparations for defence or attention to the war against the
Christians. All these precautions were the work of a
woman&mdash;a woman who had been purchased as a slave, and
had become the favourite wife of Negmeddin. The Arabian
historians are eloquent in the praise of the courage and
talents of Chegger-Eddour, and agree in saying, that no
woman surpassed her in beauty, and no man excelled her in
genius.</p>

<p>After the death of Negmeddin, the sultana assembled the
principal emirs; in this council the command of Egypt was
given to Fakreddin, and they acknowledged as sultan
Almoadam Touranschah, whom his father had banished to
Mesopotamia: some authors assert that in this council it
was resolved to send ambassadors to the king of the Franks,
to propose peace in the name of the prince of whose death
he was still ignorant. The ambassadors, in order to obtain
a truce, were to offer the Christians Damietta with its
territories, and Jerusalem with several other cities of Palestine.
It was not probable that this negotiation should
succeed; the Christians had advanced too far, and had too
much confidence in their arms, to listen to any proposition.</p>

<p>The Christian army pursued its march along the banks of
the Nile, and entered the town of Scharmesah, without
meeting any other enemy than five hundred Mussulman
horsemen. These horsemen at first evinced nothing but
pacific intentions, and, from the smallness of their numbers,
they inspired no dread.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> Louis IX., whose protection they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
seemed to implore, forbade the Crusaders to attack them;
but the Mamelukes, abusing the confidence that was placed
in them, and taking advantage of a favourable opportunity,
fell all at once upon the Templars, and killed a knight of
that order. A cry to arms immediately rung through the
French army, and the Mussulman battalion was assailed on
all sides: such as did not fall beneath the swords of the
Crusaders, were drowned in the Nile. In proportion with
the approach of the Christians to Mansourah, the anxiety
and terror of the Egyptians increased: the emir Fakreddin
exposed the dangers of the country in a letter that was read
at the hour of prayer in the great mosque of the capital.
After the formula, “<i>In the name of God and of Mahomet his
prophet</i>,” the letter of Fakreddin began by these words of the
Koran: “<i>Hasten, great and small, the cause of God has need
of your arms and of your wealth.</i>” “The Franks,” added the
emir, “the Franks (Heaven curse them) are arrived in our
country with their standards and their swords; they wish to
obtain possession of our cities and ravage our provinces:
what Mussulman can refuse to march against them, and
avenge the glory of Islamism?”</p>

<p>Upon hearing this letter read, all the people were melted
to tears; the greatest agitation prevailed throughout the
city of Cairo; the death of the sultan, which began to be
known, added greatly to the general consternation; orders
were sent to raise troops in all the Egyptian provinces; war
was preached in all the mosques, and the imauns endeavoured
by every means to awaken fanaticism, in order to combat the
depression of despair.</p>

<p>The Christian army arrived before the canal Aschmoum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
Theriah on the 19th of December. The Mussulman army
was encamped on the opposite shore, having the Nile on its
left, and behind it the city of Mansourah; close to them, in
the direction of Cairo, the Saracens had a numerous fleet
upon the river. That of the Christians had advanced to the
head of the canal. Everything seemed to announce that
the fate of the war would be decided on this spot. The
Crusaders marked out their camp in the place in which the
army of John of Brienne had encamped thirty years before.
The remembrance of a great disaster ought to have served
them as a lesson, and, at least, have tempered the excessive
confidence that the too easy conquest of Damietta had given
them.</p>

<p>The canal of Aschmoum was of the width of the Seine,
its bed was deep, and its banks steep. In order to cross it,
it was necessary that a dike should be constructed: the
work was begun, but as fast as they heaped up the sand and
stones, the Saracens dug away the earth in front of the dike,
and thus removed further back the opposite bank of the
canal; in vain the causeway advanced, the Crusaders had
always the same distance to fill up, and each of the trenches
dug by the enemy tended to make their labours useless. In
addition to which, they were night and day interrupted in
their works, and were constantly exposed to the arrows and
javelins of the Saracens.</p>

<p>Although the Mussulman general had fled without fighting
at the first appearance of the Franks, the chronicles of
the times speak very highly of his bravery and military
talents. They add that he had been made a knight by
Frederick II., and that he bore the arms of the emperor of
Germany with those of the sultans of Cairo and Damascus
upon his escutcheon. These distinctions might draw the
attention of the multitude; but that which was for Fakreddin
a true title of glory is, that he was able, by his speeches
and his example, to reanimate the courage and confidence of
a conquered army.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the Crusaders seated themselves down in
their camp, and begun the works necessary for the passage
of the Aschmoum, than Fakreddin sent a party of troops to
Scharmesah, to attack the rear of the Christian army. The
Saracens, by this unexpected assault, spread disorder and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
terror through the camp of their enemies. The first advantage
redoubled their audacity, and soon after an assault was
made upon the Christians, along the whole line of their
camp, extending from the canal to the Nile. The Mussulmans
several times passed the intrenchments of the Crusaders;
the duke of Anjou, Guy count of Forest, the sieur
de Joinville, and several other knights, were compelled to
exert all their bravery to repulse from their camp an enemy
whom every fresh combat taught that the French were not
invincible, and that it was at least possible to stop them on
their march.</p>

<p>Conflicts took place every day in the plain and upon the
river. Several vessels belonging to the Christians fell into
the hands of the Mussulmans; the Arabs, constantly prowling
round the camp, bore away into captivity every man
that ventured to stray from his colours. As the emir Fakreddin
could only learn from the reports of prisoners the
state and disposition of the Christian army, he promised a
recompense for every captive that should be brought into his
tents: all the means that audacity and cunning could suggest
were employed to surprise the Crusaders. It is related
that a Mussulman soldier having buried his head in a melon
that had been hollowed out, threw himself into the Nile, and
swam down the stream. The melon, which appeared to
float upon the water, attracted the eyes of a Christian warrior,
who sprang into the river, and as he stretched out his
hand to seize the floating melon, he himself was seized and
dragged away to the camp of the Mussulmans. This anecdote,
more whimsical than instructive, is related by several
Arabian historians, who scarcely say anything of the preceding
combats. Such are the spirit and character of the
greater part of oriental histories, in which the most frivolous
details often take the place of useful truths and important
events.</p>

<p>Whilst the armies were thus in face of each other, the
Crusaders pursued the work they had begun upon the Aschmoum.
Towers of wood and machines were constructed, to
protect the workmen employed in making the dike upon
which the Christians were to cross the canal. On their side,
the Mussulmans redoubled their efforts to prevent their
enemies from completing their work. The dike advanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
but very slowly, and the wooden towers that had been constructed
in front of the causeway, could not defend either
the workmen or the soldiers against the arrows, stones, and
fiery darts that were being constantly launched from the
camp of the Egyptians. Nothing could equal the surprise
and terror that the sight alone of the Greek fire caused the
Christian army. According to the relation of ocular witnesses,
this redoubtable fire, cast sometimes through a brass
tube, and sometimes by an instrument that was called the
<i>perrière</i>, was of the size of a tun or large cask; the flaming
tail, which it drew after it, was many feet in length; the
Crusaders imagined they beheld a fiery dragon flying through
the air; the noise of its explosion resembled that of thunder,
which rolls in repeated peals. When it was launched
during the night, it cast a lurid splendour over the whole
camp. At the first sight of this terrible fire, the knights
set to guard the towers, ran here and there, like men bewildered;
some called their companions to their aid, whilst
others threw themselves on the ground, or fell on their
knees, invoking the celestial powers. Joinville could not
conceal his fright, and thanked Heaven with all his heart
when the Greek fire fell at a distance from him. Louis IX.
was not less terrified than his barons and knights, and when
he heard the detonation of the fire, he burst into tears,
exclaiming: “Great God! Jesus Christ, protect me and all
my people!”<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<p>“The good prayers and orisons of the king,” says his historian,
“were of great service to us;” nevertheless, they were
not able to save the towers and wooden works constructed
by the Crusaders: all were consumed by the flames in sight
of the Christian army, without their having any power to
arrest their devastation. This misfortune was a lesson by
which they ought to have profited; the Christians ought to
have perceived that they had undertaken an impossible enterprise,
and that they ought to seek for some means, more
easy and more certain, of crossing the canal. But, unhappily,
the leaders persisted in causing other erections to be
made, which shared the fate of the first. They thus lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
much time, and the futility of their attempts assisted in
raising the pride and confidence of the Saracens.</p>

<p>The Mamelukes at this time learned that their new
sovereign had arrived in Damascus, and that he was hourly
expected in his capital. This arrival gave them fresh hopes,
and rendered them more confident of victory. To redouble
the ardour of his soldiers, Fakreddin often repeated, with a
tone of assurance, that he should soon go and sleep in the
tent of the king of the Franks.</p>

<p>The Christians had been a month before Aschmoum, exhausting
themselves in useless efforts. Their leaders never
took the trouble to examine if it were possible to ford the
canal, or cross it by swimming, as the Egyptian cavalry had
done. They were beginning to despair, when chance revealed
to them a means of extricating themselves from their
embarrassment, a means they might have known much
sooner, if they had had less obstinacy and more foresight.
A Bedouin Arab came to propose to Imbert de Beaujeu,
constable of France, to show him, at a distance of half a
league from the camp, a ford, by which the Crusaders might
cross without danger or obstacles, to the opposite bank of
the Aschmoum. After having ascertained that the Arab
told the truth, they paid him the sum of five hundred golden
byzants, which he had demanded, and the Christian army
prepared to profit by this happy but late discovery.</p>

<p>The king and the princes his brothers, with all the cavalry,
began their march in the middle of the night; the
duke of Burgundy remained in the camp with the infantry,
to observe the enemy, and guard the machines and the baggage.
At daybreak, all the squadrons that were to cross
the canal, awaited the signal on the bank. The count
d’Artois was ambitious of crossing first; the king, who knew
the impetuous character of his brother, at first wished to
restrain him; but Robert insisted warmly, and swore upon
the Gospel, that when he arrived on the opposite shore, he
would wait till the Christian army had passed. Louis imprudently
placed faith in the promise of a young, fiery, and
haughty knight, to master his warlike transports, and resist
all the temptations of glory on the field of battle. The
count d’Artois placed himself at the head of the van,
in which were the Hospitallers, the Templars, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
English. This van crossed the Aschmoum, and put to flight
three hundred Saracen horsemen. At the sight of the flying
Mussulmans, young Robert was on fire to pursue them. In
vain the two grand masters represented to him that the
flight of the enemy was perhaps nothing but a stratagem,
and that he ought to wait for the army, and follow the orders
of the king. Robert feared to lose an opportunity of triumphing
over the infidels, and would listen to nothing but
his ardour for conquest. He rushed on to the plain, sword
in hand, drawing the whole van after him, and pursuing the
Saracens to their camp, into which he entered with them.</p>

<p>Fakreddin, the leader of the Mussulman army, was at the
moment in the bath, and, after the custom of the Orientals,
was having his beard coloured. He sprang on horseback,
almost naked, rallied his troops, and resisted for some time;
but soon, left almost alone on the field of battle, he was
surrounded, and died, covered with a thousand wounds.</p>

<p>The whole Mussulman army fled away towards Mansourah.
How was it possible to resist the inclination to
pursue them? What was to be feared from enemies that
abandoned their camp? Might it not be believed that the
Saracens fled as they had done at Damietta, and that terror
would prevent their rallying? All these thoughts arose in
the mind of the count d’Artois, and would not permit him
to wait for the rest of the army to complete his victory. The
grand-master of the Temple in vain renewed his representations;
the young prince replied with great heat to the
counsels of experience. In his passion he accused the
Templars and Hospitallers of maintaining an intelligence
with the infidels, and with wishing to perpetuate a war that
was advantageous to their ambition. “Thus, then,” replied
the two grand masters, “it would appear that we and our
knights have abandoned our families and our country, and
would desire to pass our days in a foreign land, amidst the
fatigues and perils of war, in order to betray the cause of
the Christian church!” On finishing these words, the master
of the Templars sternly bade the standard-bearer of his
order to unfurl the banner of battle. The earl of Salisbury,
who commanded the English, ventured to speak of the
danger to which the army would be exposed, thus separated
from its van; but the count d’Artois interrupted him by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
saying, sharply, “Timid counsels do not suit us!” Then
the quarrels that had so often disturbed the discipline of the
army were renewed, and the heat of debate completely stifled
the voice of prudence. Whilst they were thus inflaming
each other, the ancient governor of the count d’Artois, who
was deaf, and who believed they were preparing for battle,
never ceased crying, “Ores à eux, ores à eux!”<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> (Hurrah!
on them! hurrah! on them!) These words became a fatal
signal for warriors, urged on at once by anger and impatience
for victory. The Templars, the English, the French, all set
forward together, all flew towards Mansourah, and penetrated
into the city abandoned by the enemy; some stopped to
pillage, whilst the others pursued the Saracens along the
road to Cairo.</p>

<p>If all the Christian troops had crossed the canal at the
moment that the count d’Artois entered Mansourah, the
defeat of the enemy could have been complete. But the
passage was made with much difficulty and confusion; and
when the French army had crossed the Aschmoum, a space of
two leagues separated it from its van.</p>

<p>The Mussulmans, who had been driven from their camp,
at first believed they had fought with all the forces of the
Crusaders, commanded by the king of France; but they
soon became aware of the small number of their enemies,
and were astonished at having been put to flight. From the
very bosom of peril and disorder, a skilful leader arose among
them, whose presence of mind all at once revived their
courage.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> Bibars Bondocdar, whom the Mamelukes had
recently placed at their head, having perceived the imprudence
of the Christians, rallied the Mussulmans, led a part
of his army between the canal and Mansourah, got possession
of the gates of the city, and, with a chosen part of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
troops, poured down upon the Crusaders, who were pillaging
the palace of the sultan. “<i>The Mamelukes, lions of fights</i>,”
says an Arabian historian, “<i>rushed upon the Franks, like a
furious tempest; their terrible maces dealing deaths and
wounds in all directions</i>.” The Christians, dispersed about
in the city, had scarcely time to rally; pressed together in
narrow streets, they could neither fight on horseback nor
make use of their swords. From the roofs of the houses and
from the windows, the Mussulmans hurled stones and other
missives, or poured down upon them heated sand and boiling
water. The gates of the city were closed, a multitude of
Mussulmans occupied all the roads, and there remained not
a single hope of salvation for warriors who had so recently
put to flight a whole army.</p>

<p>This first disaster brought on several others; and soon the
Christian army, which had just crossed the canal, found itself
in the greatest danger. As fast as the Crusaders arrived on
the other bank of the Aschmoum, some learned that the
count d’Artois was pursuing the enemy, others that he was
shut up in Mansourah, and most of the barons and knights,
who burned, according to what they heard, to share his
glory or aid him in his danger, without waiting for those
who followed them, flew first towards the camp of the Saracens,
and then towards the city.</p>

<p>The count of Brittany was one of the first who moved forward,
and he was quickly followed by Guy of Malvoisin, the
sieur de Joinville, and the bravest knights of the Christian
army. They advanced in great haste, and without the least
precaution, through a country covered with enemies; they
were not long in being separated from each other, when some
retraced their steps, but the greater part were surrounded by
the Mussulmans. A thousand combats were fought at once
upon the plain; here the Christians were conquerors, further
on they were conquered; in every direction they, by turns,
attacked their enemies or defended themselves, at one
moment putting the Saracens to flight, and the next flying
before them.</p>

<p>All at once a cloud of dust arose from the bank of the
Aschmoum, and the sound of trumpets and clarions arose,
mingled with the neighing of horses and the shouts of
warriors; it was the main body of the Christian army advancing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
Saint Louis, marching at the head of the cavalry,
halted on the summit of an acclivity, where all eyes were
turned towards him. The knights scattered about at the foot
of the hill, no longer able to resist the Saracens, believed they
saw the angel of battles come to their assistance; Joinville,
in particular, who, though pressed hard by the enemy, was,
nevertheless, struck by the majestic aspect of the monarch.
Louis wore a golden helmet, and held in his hand a German
sword; his armour was resplendent, and his noble bearing
animated all his warriors; “in short,” says the ingenuous seneschal,
in whom, perhaps, the feeling of danger increased that
of admiration, “I declare that a more noble armed man was
never seen.”<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

<p>Many of the knights who accompanied the French king,
seeing the Christian warriors engaged with the Saracens in
all directions, broke from their ranks, and rushed down to
the <i>mêlée</i>. Then the confusion proceeded fast to its climax;
every one hastened forward without knowing where the
enemy’s army was, and they very soon became equally ignorant
where that of the Christians was, or the king that commanded
it; there was no one to issue an order, and no
signal was given, except that of peril. In this horrible tumult,
prudence and caution were useless, strength and skill in
arms alone were triumphant; the mace and the battle-axe
dash polished casques and proudly-deviced shields to fragments;
some knights sink covered with wounds, others are
trampled to death beneath the feet of the horses; the cry of the
French, “Montjoie, St. Denis!” and that of the Mussulmans,
“Islam! Islam!” are confounded together, and mingle with
the plaintive voices of the dying, and the menacing clamours
of the triumphant, with the clash of cuirasses, lances, and
swords. From the canal to Mansourah, and from the Nile
to the shore whereon the Crusaders had just landed, the
country presented but one vast field of battle, where fury
and despair by turns animated the combatants, where torrents
of blood were shed on both sides, without allowing
either Christians or Mussulmans to claim the victory.</p>

<p>The Crusaders had the advantage in almost all the combats,
or more properly duels, as the fights were generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
man to man; but their army was in a great measure dispersed.
At this moment, Bibars, having left in Mansourah a sufficient
number of troops to triumph over the resistance of
the count d’Artois and his knights, set forward with all his
forces, directing his course towards the canal, for the purpose
of sustaining the Mussulmans, who were beginning to fly,
or to bring on a decisive battle. Louis and the leaders that
surrounded him at once perceived the movement and the
plans of the enemy. It was immediately decided that the
Christian army should draw near to the canal, in order to
prevent its being surrounded, and, at the same time, to preserve
some communication with the duke of Burgundy, who
remained on the opposite bank. The oriflamme, at the
head of the battalions, already pointed out the direction the
army was to take, when the counts of Poictiers and Flanders,
who had advanced into the plain, sent word to the king
that they must succumb unless speedily succoured: at the
same moment, Imbert de Beaujeu came to announce that
Robert of Artois was perishing in Mansourah. Struck by
the conflicting demands, Louis hesitated for a moment, and
in that moment a crowd of impetuous warriors, unable to
wait for his orders, galloped off, some to the succour of the
Poitevins and the Flemings, others to the aid of the count
d’Artois; the Saracens completely covered the country, and
the French warriors, who had thus separated themselves from
the king, were totally unable to contend with such a multitude
of enemies, and, falling back upon the Christian
army, produced disorder and created terror.</p>

<p>Amidst the general confusion, a report was spread that the
Mussulmans were everywhere victorious, and that the king
had given orders for retreat. Several squadrons disbanded,
and rushed towards the canal. In an instant the waters
appeared covered with drowning men and horses. In this
extreme peril, Louis in vain endeavoured to rally his troops.
His voice was scarcely heard, no one executed the orders he
endeavoured to give. He then precipitated himself into the
thickest of the fight, and so impetuously was he carried
forward by his ardour, that his squires had great difficulty
in keeping up with him; at last he remained alone, surrounded
on all sides by Saracens. Thus situated, he had to
defend himself against six Mussulman horsemen, who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
determined to take him prisoner. Louis defeated all their
endeavours, and succeeded in disengaging himself, and
putting them to flight. This brilliant act of bravery reanimated
the flying Crusaders that witnessed it; they
crowded after their gallant king, recommenced the fight, and
once more dispersed the Mussulman battalions.</p>

<p>Whilst the whole Christian army was thus fighting to
repair the faults and save the life of the count d’Artois, this
unfortunate prince was defending himself with heroic bravery;
but all his efforts, without the walls and within
the walls of Mansourah, could not free him from the host of
Saracens his imprudence had drawn upon him. Robert, with
his knights, the Templars, and the English, forgetting all
their fatal quarrels, resolved to die together as knights and
Christian soldiers. The combat had lasted from ten o’clock
in the morning till three in the afternoon; the Crusaders,
covered with wounds and stained with blood and dust, fought
on bravely, though only sustained by the flickering strength
of exhausted life. They fell almost all at the same time;
Salisbury was killed at the head of the warriors he commanded;
Robert de Vair, who bore the English banner,
folded it round him before he died; Raoul de Coucy expired
on a heap of dead; the count d’Artois, intrenched within a
house, defended himself for a long time, but at length sank
amidst carnage and ruins. The Christian warriors had
entered Mansourah to the number of fifteen hundred, and
almost all met with death there. The grand master of the
Hospitallers, left alone upon the field of battle, was taken
prisoner. The master of the Templars escaped by a miracle,
and came back in the evening to the Christian camp, wounded
in the face, his vestments torn to rags, and his cuirass
pierced in several places. He had beheld two hundred and
eighty of his knights fall around him.</p>

<p>Most of those who advanced towards Mansourah to succour
the count d’Artois, fell victims to their intrepid zeal.
The brave Guy de Malvoisin succeeded in reaching the
walls, but not in gaining entrance to the city. The duke of
Brittany made incredible efforts to gain the place of combat;
he heard the threats, cries, and tumult with which the city
resounded, without being able to force the gates or scale the
ramparts. He returned towards night-fall; he vomited blood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
in streams; his horse, stuck all over with arrows, had lost
its bridle and part of its furniture; and every warrior that
followed him was wounded. Even in this state he proved
himself terrible to the enemy, killing or driving away, with
powerful thrusts of his lance, all who dared to pursue or
oppose him, and jeering at their abortive attempts.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></p>

<p>When night separated the combatants, the prior of the
hospital of Rosnay came towards the king, and kissing his
hand, asked him if he had received any tidings of the count
d’Artois. “All that I know,” replied the pious monarch,
“is that he is now in Paradise.” The good knight, to
remove such sad thoughts, was about to expatiate upon the
advantages they had gained; but then Louis, raising his
eyes towards heaven, burst into tears. The prior of Rosnay
became silent; the barons and lords assembled round the
king were unable to offer a word of consolation, but were
all oppressed with pain, compassion, and pity at seeing him
weep.<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<p>The Christian army, although it had to reproach the
count d’Artois for all the misfortunes of this day’s conflict,
sympathized with the sorrows of Louis. Such was the
ascendancy of bravery among the French warriors, that the
greatest faults appeared to them to be expiated by a glorious
death. It was likewise acknowledged in all the crusades,
that they who died with arms in their hands were placed in
the rank of martyrs. The Christian warriors only considered
the count d’Artois as a soldier of Christ, whom God had recalled
to his bosom: it was thus that piety accorded with
glory, and that men honoured as saints the same persons
they admired as heroes. Matthew Paris asserts in his History
that the mother of Salisbury saw her son ascending into
heaven on the day of the battle of Mansourah. The same
opinion was established among the Saracens; all who fell in
the field of battle, in the wars against the Christians, passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
for martyrs of Islamism. “The Franks,” says the continuator
of Tabary, “sent Fakreddin to the banks of the celestial
river, and his end was a glorious end.”</p>

<p>History has not preserved the names of all the warriors
who signalized their valour at the battle of Mansourah.
The seneschal of Champagne was not one of those who were
backward in seeking danger, or in evincing want of courage;
one of six, he defended a bridge against a host of Saracens.
He was twice unhorsed. In such great distress, the pious
knight did not forget his patron saint, and exclaimed to him:
“My lord, great sire, St. James, I supplicate thee, aid me
and succour me in this my need.” Joinville continued
fighting during the whole day; his horse received fifteen
wounds, and he himself was pierced by five arrows.</p>

<p>The seneschal informs us that during the battle of this
memorable day, he saw several men of high distinction
running disgracefully away, in the general confusion: he
does not name them, because at the time he wrote they
were dead, and it does not appear becoming to him to speak
ill of the departed. The reserve with which the historian
here expresses himself, shows plainly enough what was the
general spirit of the French army, in which it was considered
as an ineffaceable shame, and as the greatest of misfortunes,
to have ever experienced a single moment of fear.</p>

<p>The greater part of the French warriors, when in the
presence of danger, were never abandoned by that sentiment
of honour that constituted the spirit and character of
chivalry. Erard de Severy, whilst fighting bravely with a
small number of knights, received a sabre-cut in the face;
his blood flowed fast, and it appeared not at all likely that
he would survive the wound; when, addressing the knights
that fought near him, he said, “If you will assure me that
I and my children shall be free from all blame, I will go and
demand help for you, of the duke of Anjou, whom I see
yonder on the plain.” All praised this determination highly,
and he immediately mounted on horseback, pierced through
the enemy’s squadrons, reached the duke of Anjou, and returned
with him to rescue his companions, who were near
perishing. Erard de Severy expired shortly after this heroic
achievement: he died, bearing away with him, not the sentiments
of a vain glory, but the consoling certainty that no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
blame, as he had desired, should stain his name, or that of
his children.</p>

<p>That which at the same time astonishes and charms us in
the relations of the old chroniclers who have spoken of this
battle of Mansourah is, to find, amidst scenes of carnage,
traces of French gaiety, of that gaiety which despises death
and laughs at peril. We have spoken of six knights who
defended the passage of a bridge against a great number of
Saracens; whilst these <i>preux chevaliers</i>, surrounded by
enemies, maintained such a perilous post, the count de
Soissons, addressing Joinville, exclaimed: “Seneschal, let
us leave this rascally <i>canaille</i> to cry and bray as they please,
you and I will yet talk of this day, and in ladies’ bowers
too.”</p>

<p>The Mussulmans having retired, the Christian army occupied
their camp, which the van had taken possession of in
the morning, and which the Arabs had plundered during the
battle. The camp of the enemy, and the machines of war
they had left in it, were the only fruit of the exploits of
this day. The Crusaders had shown what valour could effect,
and their triumph would have been complete if they had
been able to rally and fight together. Their leaders had not
sufficient ability or ascendancy to repair the error of the count
d’Artois; the Mussulman leaders, who proved themselves to
be more skilful, were also better seconded by the discipline
and obedience of the Mamelukes.</p>

<p>When they became fully aware of the losses they had experienced,
the Christians gave up all idea of celebrating
their victory. To appreciate the result of so many bloody
conflicts, it was quite sufficient to contemplate the contrast
between the sentiments that animated the two armies. A
melancholy sadness prevailed among the conquerors; whilst
the Saracens, on the contrary, although driven from their
camp, and obliged to fall back upon Mansourah, considered
it a triumph to have stopped the march of their enemies;
and, reassured as to the issue of the war, they abandoned
themselves to the greater joy, from having, before the battle,
entertained the most depressing fears.</p>

<p>In fact, nothing can paint the consternation which the
first attack of the count d’Artois had created among the infidels.
At the beginning of the day, a pigeon that was sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
to Cairo, conveyed a message expressed in these words:
“At the moment this bird is dispatched, the enemy is
attacking Mansourah; a terrible battle has been fought
between the Christians and the Mussulmans.” At this news
the people of Cairo were seized with the greatest terror;
and sinister reports soon added to the alarm. The gates of
the city were left open all night, to receive such as might
have fled; and all of these exaggerated the danger to excuse
their desertion. It was believed that the days of Islamism
were numbered, and many were already abandoning the
capital, to seek an asylum in Upper Egypt, when, on the
morrow, another pigeon arrived, bearing news calculated to
raise the spirits of the Mussulmans. The fresh message
announced that the God of Mahomet had declared himself
to be against the Christians; then all fears were dispersed,
and the issue of the battle of Mansourah, says an Arabian
author, <i>was the note of joy for all true believers</i>.</p>

<p>During the very night that followed the battle, the
Mussulmans made several attempts to recover their camp
and the machines of war that remained in the hands of the
Franks. The Christian warriors, oppressed by fatigue, were
repeatedly aroused by cries to arms; the continual attacks
of the enemy would not allow them to repair their strength
by sleep; many among them were so weakened by their
wounds, they could scarcely put on their cuirasses; nevertheless,
they defended themselves with their accustomed
bravery.</p>

<p>The day after the battle was Ash-Wednesday, and the
priests performed the ceremonies ordered by religion for the
opening of Lent. The Christian army passed a part of the
day in prayer, the rest of it in preparations for defence.
Whilst the soldiers of the cross prostrated themselves at the
foot of their altars, or prepared to repulse the infidels,
images of mourning were mingled in their hearts with sentiments
of piety and bravery. Whilst remembering their
past victories, they could not forbear dreading the future;
and the symbol of human fragilities, that the Church
offers to each of her children on that solemn day, must have
kept up their sad presentiments.</p>

<p>On the same day they employed themselves in throwing
a bridge over the Aschmoum, in order to form a junction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
with the camp of the duke of Burgundy. The leaders and
soldiers all lent a hand to the work, which was finished in
the space of a few hours. The infantry, which had been left
on the other side of the canal, came to reinforce the army,
which was fated to be soon engaged in fresh contests.</p>

<p>Bibars, who had the command of the Mamelukes, hastened
to take advantage of his first successes. When the body of
the count d’Artois was found, the Mamelukes exhibited his
cuirass, sown over with <i>fleurs des lis</i>, and declared it was the
spoil of the king of France. They carried about the heads
of several knights in triumph, and heralds-at-arms repeated
in a loud voice: “The Christian army is nothing but a
trunk without life, like the heads you behold on the points
of these lances.”</p>

<p>This spectacle completely inflamed the ardour of the
Mussulmans. The leaders and soldiers, with great cries,
demanded to be led against the Christians. The Mussulman
army had orders to hold themselves in readiness for battle
on the morrow, the first Friday in Lent.</p>

<p>Louis IX. was warned of the intention of the Saracens;
he gave orders to the leaders to fortify the camp, and prepare
their troops for the conflict. On the Friday, by daybreak,
the Christians were all under arms; and at the same time
the leader of the Mussulmans appeared in the plain, ranging
his men in battle-array. He placed his cavalry in the front,
behind them the infantry, and still further back, the reserve.
He extended or strengthened his lines according to the positions
he saw his enemies take. His army covered the plain
from the canal to the river. At midday he unfurled the
banners and sounded the charge.</p>

<p>The duke of Anjou was at the head of the camp on the
side towards the Nile; he was the first attacked. The
infantry of the Saracens commenced by launching the
Greek fire. This fire seized the clothes of the soldiers
and the caparisons of the horses. The soldiers, enveloped
in flames they could not extinguish, ran about uttering the
most frightful cries; the horses broke away, and created
confusion in the ranks. By means of this disorder, the
enemy’s cavalry opened themselves a passage, dispersed such
as were still fighting, and penetrated within the intrenchments.
The duke of Anjou was unable to resist the multiplied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
attacks of the Saracens; his horse having been killed
under him, he fought on foot, and, nearly overwhelmed by
the number of his enemies, he at length sent to Louis IX.
for aid.</p>

<p>The king, himself engaged with the Mussulmans, redoubles
his ardour and his efforts, drives the enemy back on
to the plain, and then flies where other dangers call him.
The knights who follow him precipitate themselves upon the
Mussulman battalions which were attacking the quarter of
the duke of Anjou. Louis is not stopped, either by the
numberless arrows shot at him, or by the Greek fire, which
covers his arms and the caparison of his horse. In the
account of this battle, Joinville is astonished that the king
of France escaped being killed, and can in no other way
explain this species of miracle than by attributing it to the
power of God: “Then it may well be believed” (we let the
seneschal of Champagne speak) “that the holy king had his
God in remembrance and wish: for, in truth, our Lord was
then a great friend to him in his need, and aided him so
effectually, that he delivered his brother, the duke of Anjou,
and drove away the Turks.”</p>

<p>On the left of the duke of Anjou, the Crusaders from the
isle of Cyprus and Palestine were encamped, under the
command of Guy d’Ibelin and his brother Baldwin. These
Crusaders had not been engaged in the last battle, and had
lost neither their horses nor their arms. Near them fought
the brave Gauthier de Chatilion, at the head of a chosen
troop. These intrepid warriors were proof against all
attacks, and remaining firm at the post confided to them,
contributed greatly to the saving of both the camp and the
army.</p>

<p>The Templars, having lost the greater part of their knights
in Mansourah, formed an intrenchment or barricade in front
of them, of the wood of the machines taken from the Saracens;
but this feeble defence was of little avail against the
Greek fire. The enemy rushed into the camp through the
flames; the Templars formed an impenetrable rampart of
their bodies, and resisted the violent attacks of the assailants
during several hours. The conflict was so severe at this
point, that the earth could scarcely be seen behind the spot
occupied by the Templars, so completely was it covered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
arrows and javelins. The grand master of the Templars lost
his life in the <i>mêlée</i>, and a great number of knights died in
defending or avenging him. The prodigies of their bravery
at last succeeded in arresting the progress of the enemy,
and the last who fell in this hardly-contested battle had the
consolation, when dying, to see the Saracens fly.</p>

<p>Guy de Malvoisin was placed near to the post which the
knights of the Temple defended so bravely; the battalion
he commanded was composed almost entirely of his relations,
and in battle presented the spectacle of a family of
warriors, ever united and ever invincible. Guy incurred
the greatest peril; he was wounded several times, but never
dreamt of retiring from the contest. His example and the
sight of his wounds redoubled the courage of his companions,
who, at length, repulsed the Mussulmans. Not far
from Guy de Malvoisin, descending towards the canal, the
Flemish Crusaders were posted. William, their count, was
at their head; they sustained the furious shock of the Mussulmans
without giving way in the least: Joinville, with some
other knights, fought on their left, and on this occasion owed
his safety to the warriors of Flanders, to whom he accords
the warmest praises. The Flemings, united with the Champenois,
put the Mussulman cavalry and infantry to flight,
pursued them out of the camp, and returned loaded with
the bucklers and cuirasses they had taken from their
enemies.</p>

<p>The count of Poictiers occupied the left wing of the
army; but as this prince had only infantry under his command,
he was unable to resist the cavalry of the Saracens.
Such were the warriors of these remote times, that when
they were not on horseback, they seemed to be disarmed,
and could not fight even for the defence of intrenchments.
The quarter confided to the Poitevins was attacked by the
Mussulmans at an early period of the fight; the Mamelukes
plundered the tents of the Christians, the brother of
the king was dragged out of the camp by some Saracen
horsemen, and was being carried away a prisoner. In this
extreme peril the count of Poictiers could not look to
Louis IX. for any assistance, as he had gone to the succour
of the count of Anjou; nor to the other leaders of the
Christian army, all so closely pressed by the enemy themselves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
This prince was adored by the people for his goodness;
and on this occasion received the reward of his virtues,
by owing his deliverance to the love with which he inspired
all the Crusaders. When the workmen, sutlers, and women
that followed the army saw him made a prisoner, they assembled
in the greatest fury, and arming themselves with axes,
clubs, sticks, or anything that fell in their way, flew after the
Mussulmans, delivered the count of Poictiers, and brought
him back in triumph.</p>

<p>At the extremity of the camp, close to the quarters of the
Poitevins, fought Josserant de Brançon, with his son and
his knights. The companions in arms of Josserant had all
left Europe well mounted and magnificently equipped: now
they all fought on foot, and had nothing left but lance and
sword. Their leader alone was on horseback, and rode from
rank to rank, exciting the soldiers, and flying to every point
where the danger seemed most pressing. This weak troop
would entirely have perished, if Henry of Brienne, who remained
in the camp of the duke of Burgundy, had not
caused his cross-bowmen to shoot across the arm of the
river, every time the Saracens renewed their attacks. Of
twenty knights that accompanied Josserant, twelve were left
upon the field of battle. This old warrior had been present
in thirty-six battles, in all of which he had borne away the
prize of valour. Joinville, when relating the exploits of
this day, remembers that he had formerly seen Josserant de
Brançon come out victorious from a combat against some
Germans who were pillaging the church of Mâcon; he had
seen him prostrate himself at the foot of the altar, and pray
with ardour for the favour of dying in fight against the
enemies of Christ. And Josserant obtained the blessing he
had asked of God; for a few days after the battle he died
of his wounds.</p>

<p>Such was the contest of which Louis IX., in the account
which he sent to France, speaks with such admirable simplicity.
“On the first Friday in Lent, the camp being
attacked, God favoured the French, and the infidels were
repulsed with much loss.”</p>

<p>In this battle, as in the last, the Christians had had all
the glory, the Saracens all the advantage. The Christian
army lost a great number of its warriors, and almost all its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
horses: the enemy was reinforced every day; the Crusaders
could not attempt to march upon Cairo, and prudence
seemed to suggest that they should retrace their steps to
Damietta. Retreat, still easy, offered a means of preserving
the army for a more favourable season: but this plan could
only be counselled by despair, and despair has great difficulty
in mastering the hearts of the brave. Nothing could appear
more disgraceful to the French than flying, or appearing to
fly, before a conquered enemy: they resolved to remain.</p>

<p>Towards the end of February, Almoadam, whom Chigger-Eddour
and the principal leaders of the Mamelukes had called
to the throne of his father, arrived in Egypt, and was received
with loud acclamations by the people, always desirous
of change, and always delighted with a new reign. The
emirs and magnates likewise displayed great joy, but their
demonstrations were less sincere; they looked for the coming
of the successor of Negmeddin with more anxiety than impatience;
placing a very high value upon that which they
had done for him, they, beforehand, expected his ingratitude.
On the other side, the young prince was jealous of his authority;
and the power of the emirs, the nature even of their
services, gave him alarms that he had not the prudence to
dissemble. It was not long before a mutual mistrust and a
reciprocal estrangement arose between Almoadam and the
leaders of the Mussulman army; the latter repented of
having raised to empire a prince who showed a disposition
to rule alone, and the former was determined to defend his
power, even against those who had bestowed it upon him. This
state of things and the disposition of men’s minds, appeared
ominous of new revolutions in Egypt; unhappily these revolutions
broke out too late to allow the Christians to derive
any advantage from them.</p>

<p>The Crusaders likewise had soon to contend with calamities
more destructive to them than even the power or the
arms of the Mussulmans; a contagious disease made its appearance
in the Christian army. They had neglected to bury
the dead after the last two battles; the bodies cast confusedly
and heedlessly into the Aschmoum, and floating on its
waters, stopped before the bridge of boats constructed by
the Crusaders, and covered the surface of the canal from one
shore to the other. Pestilential exhalations quickly arose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
from this heap of carcasses. Louis IX. ordered the bodies
of the Christians to be buried in the ditches dug by the
Saracens on the bank; but these spoils of death, moved and
transported without precaution, only assisted the progress
of the epidemic. The spectacle which was then presented
to the eyes of the Crusaders spread the deepest grief throughout
the camp, and awakened a more perfect consciousness
of their losses. Christian soldiers were seen searching
among bodies which wounds, the hues of death, and the
action of the sun and air had disfigured, for the deplorable
remains of their friends or companions. Many of those upon
whom friendship imposed this pious task, fell sick and died
almost instantly. The devotedness and grief of one of the
knights of Robert count d’Artois, were conspicuous among
these affecting instances. This inconsolable knight passed
whole nights and days on the banks of the canal, with his
eyes intensely fixed upon the waters, braving contagion and
death, in the hope of recovering and burying the young
prince, whose loss was so deeply deplored by the French
army.</p>

<p>The fatigues of war did not at all prevent the pious warriors
from observing the abstinence of Lent; and the privations
and austerities of penitence completed the exhaustion
of their strength. The contagion attacked the most robust
as well as the most weak;<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> their flesh withered away, their
skin became livid, and was covered with black spots; their
gums were inflamed and swollen so as to prevent the passage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
of food; the flowing of the blood from the nose was the sign
of approaching death. Most of the diseased viewed the grim
monarch without fear, and considered his dominions as the
wished-for end of all their sufferings.</p>

<p>Dysentery and dangerous fevers were soon added to the
above malady; nothing was heard in the Christian camp but
prayers for the dying or the dead; nothing was seen but
the pale and haggard countenances of unhappy beings who
accompanied their companions to the tomb, and whom death
must soon sweep away in their turn. The soldiers
capable of bearing arms did not suffice for the guarding of
the avenues of the camp. A thing unheard of in Christian
armies, the grooms of knights were seen clothed in the
armour of their masters, and taking their places in the post
of danger. The clergy, who attended the sick and buried the
dead, suffered greatly from the epidemic; very quickly there
were not ecclesiastics enough to minister at the altars and
perform the Christian ceremonies. One day, the sieur de
Joinville, himself sick, and listening to the mass in his bed,
was obliged to rise and support his almoner, ready to faint
upon the steps of the altar. “<i>Thus supported</i>,” adds the
kindly historian, “<i>he finished his sacrament, chanted the mass
quite through&mdash;but never chanted more</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></p>

<p>We have seen in former holy wars, multitudes of Crusaders
a prey to the most cruel scourges; the bravest of the
warriors often despaired of the cause of the pilgrims, and
deserted the banners of the cross; and many times the
excess of their misery drew from them imprecations and
blasphemies. We must here remark that the soldiers and
companions of Louis IX. supported their evils with more
patience and resignation. Not one knight thought of deserting
the banners of the crusade, and not a seditious or
sacrilegious complaint was heard in the army; the example
of the pious monarch doubtless strengthened the courage of
the Crusaders, and preserved them from the excesses of despair.
Louis IX., deeply affected by the evils that desolated
his army, employed every effort to mitigate and end them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
If anything could have consoled the Crusaders in the miserable
condition in which they were placed, it must have been
seeing a king of France himself attending the sick, lavishing
upon them every kind of assistance, and preparing them for
death. In vain he was conjured not to expose himself to
dangers still greater than those of the field of battle; nothing
could shake his courage or check the ardour of his charity;
he considered it his duty (it is thus he expressed himself) to
expose his life for those who every day exposed theirs for
him. One of his servants, a worthy man, being at the point
of death, and exhorted by a priest to meet his fate like a
Christian, replied, “<i>I will not die till I have seen the king</i>.”
The king complied with his desire, and the man died in
peace, consoled by the presence and words of his kind master.
But at length he who consoled all others fell sick himself.
The king was not able to leave his tent; the desolation became
more profound and more general; they who suffered
began now to lose all hope; it seemed as if Providence had
abandoned them, and that heaven no longer protected the
soldiers of the cross.</p>

<p>The Saracens remained motionless in their camp, leaving
their awful auxiliaries, diseases, to perform their mission
undisturbed; only Almoadam, in order to add famine to the
other evils his enemies experienced, resolved to interrupt all
communication between the Christians and Damietta, whence
they received provisions by way of the Nile. Having got
together a great number of boats, the sultan caused them to
be taken to pieces, and afterwards transported over-land
to the mouth of the canal of Mehallah. A French flotilla
came up the river without suspicion, bearing provisions for
the camp, and fell directly into an ambuscade of galleys,
placed behind a small island. All at once the enemies appear,
surprise the Christians, attack them with fury, kill a
thousand soldiers, and obtain possession of fifty vessels laden
with provisions. A few days afterwards, other vessels coming
up the river towards Mansourah experienced the same fate.
No one arrived at the camp; no news came from Damietta,
and the Christians were abandoning themselves to the most
melancholy presentiments, when a vessel belonging to the
count of Flanders, which had escaped the enemy by a miracle,
came to announce to them that all the vessels of the Crusaders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
had been taken, and that the Mussulman flag dominated
along the whole course of the river.</p>

<p>Famine soon made frightful ravages in the army; and
such as had been spared by disease, were threatened with
death from misery and hunger. Both leaders and soldiers
were seized with the deepest despondency; and the king at
length judged it best to attempt to enter into a truce with
the Mussulmans. Philip de Montfort was employed in the
embassy to the sultan of Egypt; commissioners were named
on both sides to conclude a treaty. Those of the king of
France proposed to surrender Damietta to the sultan, on
condition that Jerusalem and all the other places in Palestine,
that had fallen into the hands of the Mussulmans in the
late wars, should be given up to the Christians. The sultan,
who dreaded the bravery and the despair of the Crusaders,
who, besides, had reason to fear that his enemies might
receive reinforcements, and that Damietta might hold out
for a considerable time, accepted the proposed conditions.
When the question of hostages came to be discussed, the
king offered his two brothers; but whether the sultan placed
no faith in the loyalty of his enemies, or whether he was
wanting in it himself, he required that the king of France
should remain in his hands, as a guarantee of the treaty.
Sergines, one of the commissioners, could not listen to
this proposal without anger. “You ought to know Frenchmen
better,” cried he, “than to suppose they would ever
allow their king to remain a prisoner with Mussulmans.”
A council was held on this subject in the Christian army.
The king consented to everything, but the lords and barons
exclaimed with vehemence against the giving up of their
sovereign. On one side, the monarch was willing to purchase
the safety of his people by his own personal danger;
on the other, a crowd of warriors all warmly declared
they could not suffer such a disgrace, and that <i>they would
rather die than place their king in pledge</i>. The more Louis
was beloved by his warriors, the less he was master in this
circumstance; and every one thinking it to his honour, and
almost consistent with his duty, to disobey him, the negotiation
was abandoned.</p>

<p>To paint the frightful scarcity that desolated the Christian
camp, contemporary chronicles relate, as an extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
thing, that a sheep was sold for as much as ten crowns, an
ox for eighty livres, and an egg for twelve deniers. Such
high prices exceeded the means of most of the pilgrims;
some were obliged to live upon the fish caught in the Nile,
others upon herbs and roots.</p>

<p>Louis IX. preserving his courage and tranquillity of mind
amidst the general mourning and depression, as a means of
endeavouring to save the miserable remains of his army, resolved
to repass to the other side of the Aschmoum. Whilst
the Christians were crossing the wooden bridge thrown over
the canal, they were warmly attacked by the Mussulmans.
Gaucher de Chatillon, who commanded the rear, at first repulsed
them; but as the Saracens returned several times to
the charge, and as they had greatly the advantage in numbers,
victory was upon the point of being adverse to the
Crusaders. The brilliant valour of the count of Anjou
checked the impetuosity of the Mussulmans. Erard and
John de Valeri performed prodigies of bravery. Jeffroi de
Hassemburgh likewise distinguished himself by heroic actions,
and merited the palm of valour in that day’s fight.
Thus glory was always mingled with the misfortunes of the
French Crusaders: but victory procured them no advantages,
and always left them still exposed to the same perils,
still a prey to the same calamities. They were not more
fortunate on one side of the Aschmoum than on the other;
and after remaining some days in their old camp, they were
obliged at length to form the disheartening resolution of returning
to Damietta.</p>

<p>As soon as Almoadam was informed of these last dispositions
of the Christians, he himself harangued his troops,
distributed provisions and money to them, and reinforced
them with a great number of Arabs, attracted to his standards
by the hopes of booty. By his orders, boats loaded
with soldiers descended the Nile, and joined the Mussulman
fleet that had intercepted the convoys of the Crusaders.
Bodies of light cavalry were distributed along the whole
course of the roads which the French army would take in
its retreat.</p>

<p>On the fifth day of April,<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> the Tuesday after the octave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
of Easter, Louis IX. ordered everything to be prepared for
the departure of his army: the women, the children, and
the sick were embarked upon the Nile; they waited till
night-fall, to conceal these sad preparations from the enemy.
The bank of the Nile presented the most heart-breaking
spectacle; nothing was to be seen but Crusaders overcome
by their sufferings, parting, with tears in their eyes, from
friends they were doomed never to see again. Amidst
these painful scenes, the Arabs, taking advantage of the
darkness of the night, penetrated into the camp, plundered
the baggage, and slaughtered every living creature they met
with. A terrified crowd fled on all sides, and cries of alarm
resounded along the whole bank of the river. The mariners
perceiving, by the light of the fires in the boats, this frightful
disorder, and that the Christians were being massacred,
became terrified on their own account, and prepared to depart.
The king, who, in spite of his weakness, was present
everywhere, and watched over everything, drove the infidels
from the camp, reassured the Christian multitude, and commanded
the vessels which had left the shore, to put back and
take the rest of the sick on board.</p>

<p>The pope’s legate and several French nobles got on board
a large vessel. The king was pressed to follow this example,
but he could not make up his mind to abandon his
army. In vain his anxious and loving friends represented
to him that his state of weakness would not permit him to
fight, and exposed him to the risk of falling into the hands
of the Saracens; in vain they added, that by thus hazarding
his life he compromised the safety of the army. These and
many other remonstrances, dictated by sincere attachment
for his person, were not able to make him change his resolution.
He replied, that no danger should separate him from
his faithful warriors; that he had brought them with him;
that he would return with them; or, if it proved necessary,
die in the midst of them. This heroic determination, the
inevitable consequences of which were foreseen, plunged all
his knights into consternation and grief. The soldiers, partaking
the feelings of the knights, ran along the bank of
the Nile, crying with all their strength to those that were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
going down the river, “Wait for the king! wait for the
king!”<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> Arrows and javelins were falling thick upon the
vessels which continued to go down the river. Many stopped;
but Louis insisted upon their pursuing their course.</p>

<p>Most of the French warriors were borne down by disease
and weakened by hunger. The fatigues and new perils they
were about to undergo did not at all diminish their courage;
but they could not endure the thoughts of abandoning
places rendered dear to them by the remembrance of their
victories. The duke of Burgundy set out on his march at
night-fall; and, a short time after, the rest of the troops
quitted the camp, taking away their tents and baggage.
Louis, who was determined to go with the rear-guard, only
kept with him the brave Sergines and a few other knights
and barons who were still fortunate enough to have horses.
The king, scarcely able to support himself in his saddle,
appeared in the midst of them mounted on an Arabian
horse; he wore neither helmet nor cuirass, and had no other
weapon but his sword. The warriors who had surrounded
his person, followed him in silence; and in the deplorable
state to which they were reduced, evinced still some joy at
having been chosen to defend their king and die by his side.</p>

<p>The retreat of the Christian army was already known to
the Saracens. The king had ordered the bridge of Aschmoum
to be broken; but this order had not been executed,
and it furnished the Mussulmans with an easy means of
crossing the canal. In a moment the whole plain which
extended on the Damietta side was covered with enemies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
The rear-guard of the Christians was stopped at every step
of its route, sometimes by the crossing of a rivulet, but
more frequently by a charge of Mussulman cavalry. Amidst
the darkness of the night, the Crusaders could not see which
way to direct their blows, and when they did obtain some
trifling advantage, they did not dare to pursue their enemy;
they advanced fighting, and in disorder; fearing to lose
themselves, such as were at any distance from their companions,
called upon them by name; such as adhered closely
to the standard, ran against and impeded each other in their
march: over the whole plain nothing was heard but the
neighing of horses, the clash of arms, and cries of rage and
despair; but the most deplorable spectacle in this defeat was
that of the wounded lying stretched along the roads, holding
up their hands to their comrades, and conjuring them,
with tears, not to leave them exposed to the fury of the
Saracens. They looked for day with the most anxious impatience;
but the daylight, by discovering the small number
of the Christians, redoubled the confidence of the Mussulmans:
it filled the former with proportionate dread, as it
showed them the multitude of their enemies.</p>

<p>Menaced and pursued on all sides, the knights who had
taken the route by land, envied those who had embarked
upon the Nile; but these latter were in no less danger than
their unfortunate companions. A short time after their
departure, a high wind arose, and drove back the vessels
towards Mansourah: some of them were run aground,
others were dashed violently against accompanying boats,
and were near being sunk. Towards dawn their flotilla
arrived near Mehallah, a place fatal to the Christians. The
Mussulman fleet awaited them there. The archers charged
to proceed along the shore and protect them, had fled, and
in their place appeared a multitude of Mussulman horsemen,
launching such a number of arrows armed with the
Greek fire, that it might have been believed, says Joinville,
“<i>that all the stars of heaven were falling</i>.”</p>

<p>The wind disconcerted all the manœuvres of the mariners.
The Crusaders, crowded closely in their vessels, could scarcely
stand upright, and were most of them without arms. Turning
their eyes, sometimes towards the shore, where they
perceived clouds of dust at a distance, and sometimes towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
heaven, whose mercy they implored, they still hoped that
some unexpected event might deliver them, or else that the
army advancing towards Damietta would come to their succour;
thus placing their last hopes in the miracles of Providence
and in those of bravery. Deceitful illusions! one
division of the Christian troops had been dispersed; the
rear-guard, encouraged by the presence of the king, made
incredible but useless efforts to repulse the crowd of Saracens,
which increased from moment to moment. The despair
of the French warriors gave birth to a thousand glorious
actions; but so much heroism was only able to procure them
the palm of martyrdom. Guy du Châtel, bishop of Soissons,
giving up all hopes of gaining Damietta or revisiting France,
resolved to seek death, and rushed, followed by several
knights, into the thickest of the ranks of the Saracens, who,
according to the expression of Joinville, <i>killed them, and
sent them into the company of God</i>. Gaucher de Chatillon
and Sergines still fought on, in the hope of saving the life of
the king of France. Sergines, adhering close to the side of
the king, drove away the enemies with mighty blows of the
sword; danger seemed to have doubled his strength. Contemporary
history, which describes him to us driving away
the Saracens that surrounded Louis, compares him to the
vigilant servant who carefully drives away the flies from his
master’s cup.</p>

<p>In the mean time the hope of victory inflamed the enthusiasm
and the fanaticism of the Mussulmans; they were persuaded
they were fighting for the cause of their prophet:
their dervises and imauns, who had preached the war against
the Christians, followed them on the field of battle, pervaded
the ranks of the army, and excited the soldiers to carnage.<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>
An Arabian historian, mixing the marvellous with his account,
relates that the scheikh Ezzedin, seeing that victory
for a moment inclined towards the Christians, because a
whirlwind of dust covered the Mussulmans and prevented
them from fighting, addresses these words to the wind: “<i>Oh
wind, direct thy breath against our enemies!</i>” The tempest,
adds the same historian, obeyed the voice of this holy person,
and victory was the reward of the soldiers of Islamism. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
only report this circumstance here, to show the spirit that
animated the Mussulmans in their wars against the Christians.
The Saracens did not require a miracle to triumph
over a dispersed army reduced to so small a number of combatants.
The rear-guard of the Christians, always pursued
and unceasingly attacked, arrived with much difficulty before
the little town of Minieh.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> The king, escorted by a few
knights, preceded the troops into the city, where he alighted
as weak “as a child in its mother’s lap,” says Joinville.
Fatigue, sickness, and the grief which such disasters caused
him, had so overcome him, that all believed (we still quote

<p>The intrepid Gaucher de Chatillon watched over his
safety; alone, he for a length of time defended the entrance
of a narrow street, which led to the house in which his
faithful servants were endeavouring to recall the exhausted
monarch to life. At one moment he rushed like lightning
upon the infidels, dispersed them, cut them down; then,
after turning to pull from his cuirass, and even his body, the
arrows and darts with which he was stuck all over, he flew
again upon the enemy, rising from time to time in his stirrups,
and shouting with all his force, “Chatillon, knights!
Chatillon, to the rescue! Where are ye, my gallant men?”
The remainder of the rear-guard were still at some distance;
nobody appeared, but the Saracens, on the contrary, came
up in crowds; at length, overwhelmed by numbers, bristling
with arrows, and covered with wounds, he fell; none of the
Crusaders could succour him, not one could witness his
heroic end! His horse, one sheet of blood and foam, became
the prey of the infidels, and his last exploits were narrated
by a Mussulman warrior, who exhibited his sword, and
boasted of having killed the bravest of the Christians.</p>

<p>The rear-guard drew up upon a neighbouring hill, and
still defended themselves with some advantage. Philip de
Montfort, who commanded them, came to inform the king
that he had just seen the emir with whom they had treated
for a suspension of hostilities at the camp of Mansourah;
and if it were his good pleasure, he would go and speak to
him about it again. The monarch consented, promising to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
submit to the conditions the sultan had first required.
However miserable the situation of the Crusaders, they still
inspired considerable dread in their enemies. Five hundred
knights remained under arms, and many of those who had
gone past Minieh, retraced their steps to dispute the victory
with the Saracens. The emir accepted the proposition for a
truce. Montfort, as a pledge of his word, gave him a ring
which he wore on his finger. Their hands already touched,
when a <i>traitor</i>, <i>a rascal doorkeeper</i>, named Marcel, cried
aloud: “Seigneurs, noble French knights, surrender yourselves
all, the king commands you by me; do not cause him
to be killed!” At these last words, the consternation
became general; they believed that the life of the monarch
was in great danger, and the leaders, officers, and soldiers,
all laid down their arms.</p>

<p>The emir, who had begun to treat for peace, perceived this
sudden change, and he broke off the negotiation by saying:
“It is not customary to treat with conquered enemies.”
Soon after, one of the principal emirs, Djemal-eddin, entered
Minieh. Finding the king surrounded by his weeping
servants, he took possession of his person, and without any
regard for royal majesty, without any respect for the greatest
misfortunes, ordered chains to be placed upon his hands and
feet; from that moment there was no safety for the Crusaders.
Both the brothers of the king fell into the hands of
the infidels; all those that had reached Pharescour, were
seized, and lost either their lives or their liberty. Many of
them might have gained Damietta; but when they learnt the
captivity of the king, they lost all strength or spirit to continue
their route or to defend themselves. These knights,
but lately so intrepid, remained motionless on the high roads,
and allowed themselves to be slaughtered or manacled,
without offering the least complaint or making the slightest
resistance. The oriflamme, the other standards, and the
baggage, all became the prey of the Saracens. Amidst
scenes of carnage, the Mussulman warriors uttered the most
horrible imprecations against Jesus Christ and his defenders:
they trampled under-foot, they profaned by insults, crosses
and sacred images&mdash;a crowning cause for scandal and despair
for Christians, who, having seen their king loaded with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
chains, beheld their God given up to the outrages of the
conqueror!</p>

<p>The Crusaders who had embarked upon the Nile had no
better destiny; all the vessels of the Christians, except that
of the legate, were sunk by the tempest, consumed by the
Greek fire, or taken by the Mussulmans. The crowd of
Saracens, assembled on the shore or on board the barks,
immolated all that came within reach of their arms. They
spared neither the women nor the sick. Avarice, rather
than humanity, saved such as could expect to be ransomed.
The sieur de Joinville, still suffering from his wounds and
the disease that had prevailed in the camp of Mansourah,
had embarked with the only two knights he had left and
some of his serving-men. Four Mussulman galleys came
up to his vessel, which had just cast anchor in the middle of
the river, and the soldiers threatened them with instant
death if they did not at once surrender. The seneschal deliberated
with the persons of his suite upon what was best
to be done in such an imminent danger: all agreed that it
would be most prudent to surrender, except one of his ecclesiastics,
who said it would be best to be killed, that they might
go at once to Paradise; but this the others were not willing
to comply with. Joinville then took a little coffer, and
emptying it of the jewels and relics it contained, he threw
them into the water, and surrendered at discretion. In spite
of the laws of war, the seneschal would have been killed, if
a renegade, who knew him, had not covered him with his
body, crying: “It is the king’s cousin!” Joinville, scarcely
able to support himself, was dragged into a Mussulman
galley, and from that transported to a house close to the
shore. As they had deprived him of his coat of mail, and he
remained almost without covering, the Saracens, whose
prisoner he was, gave him a little cap, which he placed upon
his head, and threw over his shoulders a scarlet cloak of his
own, furred with minever, which his mother had given him:
he was trembling all over, as well from his disease as the
great fear that possessed him. Being unable to swallow a
glass of water that was given to him, he believed himself to
be dying, and called his servants around him, who all began
to weep. Among those who wept the most bitterly, was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
young boy, a natural son of the seigneur Montfaucon. This
child, upon seeing the persons perish who had charge of him,
had thrown himself into the arms and under the protection
of Joinville. The sight of abandoned infancy and the despair
of the worthy seneschal, excited the compassion of
some of the emirs that were present, and one of them, whom
Joinville at one time calls the <i>good Saracen</i>, and at another
the <i>poor Saracen</i>, took pity on the boy, and when he left the
seneschal, he said to him, “Be sure to hold this little child constantly
by the hand, or I am certain the Saracens will kill him.”</p>

<p>The carnage was prolonged for a considerable time after
the battle; it lasted during many days. All the captives
that had escaped the first fury of the Mussulman soldiers,
were landed; and woe to such as sickness had weakened or
as exhibited marks of poverty! the more worthy the victims
were of pity, the more they roused the barbarity of the
conquerors. Soldiers armed with swords and maces, charged
to execute the terrible sentence of victory, awaited the
prisoners on the shore. John of Vaissy, the priest, and
some other servants belonging to Joinville, crawled from the
ships in a dying state: the Saracens completed the work
before the eyes of their master, saying that these poor
wretches were good for nothing, and could pay for neither
their liberty nor their lives.</p>

<p>In these days of disasters and calamities, more than thirty
thousand Christians lost their lives, killed on the field of
battle, drowned in the Nile, or massacred after the fight.
The news of this victory obtained by the Mussulmans was
soon spread throughout Egypt. The sultan of Cairo wrote
to the governor of Damascus, to inform him of the last
triumphs of Islamism. “Let thanks be rendered,” said he
in his letter, “to the All Powerful, who has changed our
sadness into joy; it is to him alone we owe the glory of our
arms; the blessings with which he has deigned to favour us
are numberless, and the last is the most precious of all.
You will announce to the people of Damascus, or rather to
all Mussulmans, that God has enabled us to gain a complete
victory over the Christians, at the moment they were conspiring
to effect our ruin.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></p>

<p>The day after that on which the Christian army had laid
down their arms, the king of France was taken to Mansourah
on board a war-boat, escorted by a great number of
Egyptian vessels. The trumpets and kettle-drums carried
the notes of triumph to a vast distance. The Egyptian
army, in order of battle, marched along the eastern bank of
the Nile as the fleet advanced. All the prisoners whom the
fury of the enemy had spared, followed the Mussulman
troops, with their hands tied behind them. The Arabs
were in arms on the western bank, and the multitude flocked
from all parts to witness this strange spectacle. On his
arrival at Mansourah, Louis IX. was confined in the house
of Fakreddin ben Lokman, secretary of the sultan, and
placed under the guard of the eunuch Sabyh. A vast inclosure,
surrounded by walls of earth, and guarded by the
fiercest of the Mussulman warriors, received the other
prisoners of war.</p>

<p>The news of these disasters carried consternation and despair
to the city of Damietta, over the walls of which the
standard of the French still floated. Confused reports at
first were circulated; but soon a few Crusaders, who had
escaped from the carnage, announced that the whole Christian
army had perished. Queen Marguerite was on the point
of being confined: her terrified imagination, at one moment,
represented to her her husband falling beneath the swords
of the enemy, and at the next, the Saracens at the gates of
the city. Her emotions became so violent, that her servants
believed her to be expiring. A knight of more than eighty
years of age served her as esquire, and never left her either
night or day. This unhappy princess, after having, for a
moment, sobbed herself to sleep, started up in the greatest
terror, imagining that her chamber was filled with Saracens
about to kill her. The old knight, who had held her hand
while she slept, pressed it, and said: “Be not afraid,
madam, I am with you.” An instant after she had reclosed
her eyes, she awoke again, and uttered loud and fearful cries,
and the grave esquire reassured her again. At length, to free
herself from these cruel alarms, the queen ordered every one
to leave her chamber except her knight, and then, throwing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
herself upon her knees before him, with tearful eyes, she exclaimed:
“Sir knight, promise that you will grant the favour
I am about to ask of you.” He promised upon his oath.
Marguerite then continued: “I require you, on the faith
you have pledged to me, that if the Saracens should take
this city, you will cut off my head rather than allow me to
become their captive.” “Certainly, I will do it,” replied
the old knight; “I meant to do so, if the thing should so
happen!”<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></p>

<p>On the morrow the queen was brought to bed of a son,
who was named Jean Tristan, on account of the melancholy
circumstances amidst which he was born. The same day her
attendants informed her that the Pisans, and many Crusaders
from the maritime cities of Europe, were desirous of abandoning
Damietta and returning to their homes. Marguerite
caused the leaders of them to be brought before her bed, and
said to them: “Seigneurs, for the love of God, do not quit
this city; its loss would bring on that of the king and of
the whole Christian army. Be moved by my tears, have
pity on the poor child that you behold lying beside me!”
The merchants of Genoa and Pisa were at first but very
little affected by these words. Joinville reproaches them
with bitterness for their want of feeling for the cause of
Christ, or for that of humanity. As they answered the queen
that they had no provisions left, this princess gave orders
that all the provisions in Damietta should be immediately
bought up, and caused it to be announced to the Genoese
and Pisans, that from that time they should be supported
at the expense of the king. By this means, the city of
Damietta preserved a garrison and defenders, whose presence,
more than their valour, produced an effect upon the Saracens.
It is even asserted that the Mussulmans, after the victory of
Minieh, being desirous of surprising Damietta, presented
themselves before the walls, clothed in the arms and bearing
the standards of the conquered Christians; but they were
betrayed by their language, their long beards, and their
bronzed countenances. As the Christians showed themselves
in great numbers upon the ramparts, the enemy drew
off in haste from a city which they believed was disposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
defend itself, but in which, really, nothing but despondency
and fear prevailed.</p>

<p>During this time, Louis IX. was more calm at Mansourah
than they were at Damietta. That which misery and misfortune
have of the most bitter for the exalted of this
world, only served to develop in him the virtue of a Christian
hero and the character of a great king. He had no covering
at night but a coarse cassock, which he owed to the charity
of another prisoner. In this state, he never addressed one
petition to his enemies, nor did the tone of his language
announce either fear or submission. One of his almoners
afterwards attested upon oath, that Louis never suffered a
word of despair or a movement of impatience to escape from
him. The Mussulmans were astonished at this resignation,
and said among themselves, that if ever their prophet should
leave them a prey to such great adversities, they would
abandon his faith and his worship. Of all his riches, Louis
had only saved his book of psalms, too sterile a spoil to be
worth the attention of the Saracens; and when all the world
seemed to have abandoned him, this book alone consoled him
in his misfortunes. He every day recited those hymns of
the prophets in which God himself speaks of his justice and
his mercy, reassures virtue which suffers in his name, and
threatens with his anger those whom prosperity intoxicates,
and who abuse their triumph.</p>

<p>Thus religious sentiments and remembrances sustained
the courage of Louis even in fetters; and the pious monarch,
surrounded every day by fresh perils, amidst a Mussulman
army that he had irritated by his victories, might still cry
out with the prophet-king: “Supported by the living God,
who is my buckler and my glory, I will not fear the crowd
of enemies encamped around me.”</p>

<p>The sultan of Cairo, appearing inclined to soften his
rigorous policy, sent Louis fifty magnificent dresses for himself
and the lords of his train. Louis refused to clothe
himself in them, saying that he was the sovereign of a
greater kingdom than Egypt, and that he would never wear
the livery of a foreign prince. Almoadam ordered a great
feast to be prepared, to which he invited the king. But
Louis would not accept of this invitation, as he was persuaded
it was only meant to exhibit him as a spectacle to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
Mussulman army. At length the sultan sent his most skilful
physicians to him, and did all he could to preserve a
prince whom he destined to adorn his triumph, and by whose
means he hoped to obtain the advantages attached to his last
victory. Before long he proposed to the king to break his
chains upon condition of his giving up Damietta and the
cities of Palestine that were still under the power of the
Franks. Louis replied, that the Christian cities of Palestine
did not belong to him; that God had recently replaced
Damietta in the hands of the Christians, and that no human
power had the right to dispose of it. The sultan, irritated
by this refusal, resolved to employ violence. At one time he
threatened Louis to send him to the caliph of Bagdad, who
would closely imprison him till death; at another, he
announced the project of leading his illustrious captive
throughout the East, and of exhibiting to all Asia a king of
the Christians reduced to slavery. At length he went so far
as to threaten to have him placed in the <i>bernicles</i>,<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> a frightful
punishment reserved for the greatest criminals. Louis
still showed himself firm, and, as the only reply to all these
menaces, said, “I am the sultan’s prisoner, he can do with
me what he pleases.”</p>

<p>The king of France suffered, though he did not complain;
he feared nothing on his own account, but when he thought
of his faithful army, and of the fate of the other captives,
his heart was a prey to the deepest sorrow. The Christian
prisoners were crowded into one open court, some sick,
others wounded, the greater part naked, and all exposed to
hunger, the injuries of the elements, and the ill-treatment
of their pitiless guards. A Mussulman was commanded to
write the names of all these wretched captives, whose number
amounted to more than ten thousand. They led all
such as could purchase their liberty into a vast tent; the
others remained in the place into which they had been
driven like a flock of animals, destined to perish miserably.
Every day an emir, by the sultan’s orders, entered this
abode of despair, and caused two or three hundred prisoners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
be be dragged out of the inclosure. They were asked if
they would abjure the religion of Christ, and those whom
the fear of death induced to desert their faith, received their
liberty; the others were put to the sword, and their bodies
were cast into the Nile. They were slaughtered during the
night; silence and darkness adding to the horrors of the
execution. During several days the steel of the executioner
thus decimated the unhappy prisoners. None were ever
seen to return who went out of the inclosure. Their sad
companions, on bidding them farewell, wept beforehand over
their tragical end, and lived in certain expectation of a similar
fate. At length the lassitude of slaughter caused those that
remained to be spared. They were led away to Cairo; and
the capital of Egypt, into which they had flattered themselves
they should enter in triumph, beheld them arrive
covered with rags and loaded with chains. They were
thrown into dungeons, where many died of hunger and
grief; the others, condemned to slavery in a foreign land, deprived
of all assistance and of all communication with their
leaders, without knowing what was become of their king,
were hopeless of ever recovering their liberty, or of revisiting
the West.</p>

<p>The Oriental historians relate the scenes we have just
described with indifference; many even seem to consider the
massacre of prisoners of war as a second victory; and, as
if the misfortune and murder of a disarmed enemy could
heighten the glory of a conqueror, they exaggerate in their
accounts the misery of the vanquished, and particularly the
number of the victims immolated to Islamism.</p>

<p>The barons and knights that were shut up in the pavilion,
were not ignorant of the fate of their companions in arms;
they passed their days and nights in continual terrors. The
sultan wished to obtain from them that which he had not
been able to obtain from Louis IX. He sent an emir to
inform them that he would set them at liberty if Damietta
and the Christian cities of Palestine were restored to the
Mussulmans. The count of Brittany replied in the name
of all the prisoners, that that which was asked of them was
not in their power, and that French warriors had no other
will than that of their king. “It is plainly to be perceived,”
said the messenger of Almoadam, “that you care very little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
for liberty or life. <i>You shall see some men accustomed to
sword-playing.</i>” The emir retired, leaving the prisoners in the
expectation of an early death. The apparatus of punishment
was exhibited before them. The sword remained several
days suspended over their heads; but Almoadam could make
no impression upon their firmness. Thus, neither the captivity
of an entire army, nor the death of so many warriors,
had been able to deprive the Christians of a single one of
their conquests, and one of the bulwarks of Egypt was still
in their hands. The conquerors prayed and threatened by
turns; the conquered resisted all their endeavours, and
always appeared masters.</p>

<p>In the mean time several French nobles offered to pay
their own ransom. Louis was informed of this; and as he
feared that many, not having the means to redeem themselves,
would remain in chains, he forbade any particular
treaty. The barons and knights, but lately so intractable,
did not persist in opposing the will of an unfortunate king,
and instantly gave up all idea of a separate negotiation. The
king said he would pay for everybody, and that he would
never think about his own liberty till after he had assured
that of all others.</p>

<p>Whilst the sultan of Cairo was thus making useless
attempts to overcome the pride and lower the courage of
Louis and his knights, the favourites he had brought with
him from Mesopotamia pressed their master to conclude the
peace quickly. “You have,” said they to him, “enemies
much more dangerous than the Christians; they are the
emirs, who wish to reign in your place, and who never cease
to boast of their victories, as if you had not yourself conquered
the Franks, as if the God of Mahomet had not sent
pestilence and famine to aid you in triumphing over the
defenders of Christ: hasten, then, to terminate the war, in
order that you may strengthen your power within, and begin
to reign.” These speeches, which flattered the pride of
Almoadam, induced him to make rather more reasonable
proposals to his enemies. The sultan limited his demand to
a ransom of a million of golden byzants, and the restitution
of Damietta. Louis, aware that the city of Damietta could
not resist, consented to the proposals that were made to
him, <i>if the queen approved of them</i>. As the Mussulmans expressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
some surprise at this, the king added, “<i>The queen is
my lady, I can do nothing without her consent.</i>” The ministers
of the sultan returned a second time, and told the French
monarch, that if the queen would pay the sum agreed upon,
he should be free. “A king of France,” answered he, “is
not to be redeemed by money; the city of Damietta shall
be given up for my deliverance,<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> and a million of golden
byzants paid for that of my army.” The sultan agreed to
all; and, whether he was pleased at having terminated the
negotiations, or whether he was touched by the noble character
the captive monarch had displayed, he reduced the
sum fixed upon as the ransom of the Christian army a fifth.</p>

<p>The knights and barons were still ignorant of the conclusion
of the treaty, and were revolving in their minds their
customary melancholy reflections, when they saw an old
Saracen enter their pavilion. His venerable figure and the
gravity of his carriage inspired respect. His train, composed
of men-at-arms, inspired fear. The old man, without any
preliminary discourse, asked the prisoners, by means of an
interpreter, if it was true that they believed in a God, born
of a woman, crucified for the salvation of the human race,
and resuscitated the third day? All having answered at
once that that was their belief: “In that case,” added he,
“congratulate yourselves at suffering for your God; you are
yet far from having suffered as much for him as he suffered
for you. Place your hopes in him, and if he has been
able to recall himself to life, he will not want power to put
an end to the evils that afflict you now.”</p>

<p>On finishing these words, the old Mussulman retired,
leaving the Crusaders divided between surprise, fear, and
hope. On the next day it was announced to them that the
king had concluded a truce, and wished to take counsel of
his barons. John of Vallery, Philip de Montfort, and Guy
and Baldwin d’Ibelin were deputed to wait upon the king.
It was not long before the Crusaders learnt that their captivity
was about to end, and that the king had paid the
ransom of the poor as well as the rich. When these brave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
knights turned their thoughts towards their victories, they
never could conceive how it was possible for them to have
fallen into the hands of the infidels; and when they reflected
on their late misfortunes, their deliverance appeared equally
miraculous to them. All raised their voices in praises to
God and benedictions to the king of France.</p>

<p>All the cities of Palestine that had belonged to the Christians
at the arrival of the Crusaders in the East, were comprised
in the treaty. On both sides, the prisoners of war
made since the truce concluded between the emperor Frederick
and Melik-Kamel, were to be given up. It was agreed,
also, that the munitions and machines of war belonging to
the Christian army should remain provisionally at Damietta,
under the safeguard of the sultan of Egypt.</p>

<p>It next became the object to perform the conditions of the
treaty of peace. Four large galleys were prepared to transport
the principal prisoners to the mouth of the Nile. The
sultan left Mansourah, and repaired to Pharescour by land.</p>

<p>After the battle of Minieh, a vast palace, built of fir
timber, of which the chronicles of the times have left pompous
descriptions, had been erected in that city. It was in
this palace Almoadam received the felicitations of the Mussulmans,
upon the happy issue of a war against the enemies
of Islamism. All the cities, all the principalities of Syria,
sent ambassadors to salute the conqueror of the Christians.
The governor of Damascus, to whom he had sent a helmet,
found on the field of battle, that had belonged to the king
of France, replied to him thus: “There is no doubt that God
destines for you the conquest of the universe, or that you
will proceed from victory to victory; who can doubt of this
when we already see your slaves clothed in the spoils of conquered
kings?” Thus the young sultan imbibed intoxicating
draughts of praise, and passed his time in the festivities
and pleasures of peace, forgetting the cares of his
empire, and foreseeing none of the dangers which threatened
him amidst his triumphs.</p>

<p>Almoadam had disgraced, and deprived of their places,
many of the ministers of his father; most of the emirs were
in fear of a similar fall, and this fear even led them to brave
everything for the preservation of their fortunes and their
lives. Among these malcontents, the Mamelukes and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
leader were most conspicuous. This military body owed
their origin to Saladin, and they had enjoyed the greatest
privileges under the preceding reign. They reproached the
sultan with preferring young favourites to old warriors, the
support of the throne and the saviours of Egypt. They reproached
him with having concluded a peace, without consulting
those who had supported the burden of the war; and with
having bestowed the spoils of the vanquished upon courtiers,
who had only deserved them by coming from the banks of
the Euphrates to the shores of the Nile. In order to justify
beforehand all they might attempt against the prince, they
attributed to him projects of the most sinister nature; and
nascent rebellion inflamed itself by the recital of future persecutions.
The emirs who were to die were designated;
the instruments of death were named, the day was fixed,
everything was appointed, everything was ready. It was
asserted that the sultan, in the course of one of his nocturnal
orgies, had cut off the tops of the flambeaux in his apartment,
crying, “Thus shall fly the heads of all the Mamelukes.”
A woman animated the minds of the warriors by her discourse:
this was Chegger-Eddour, who, having disposed
of the empire, could not endure the neglect of the new sultan.
From complaints they soon passed to open revolt;
for it was less perilous to attack the prince sword in hand,
than to declaim for any length of time against him. A conspiracy
was formed, in which the Mamelukes and all the
emirs who had outrages to avenge or to fear were concerned.
The conspirators were impatient to execute their project,
and fearing that the sultan, if once arrived at Damietta,
might escape them, they resolved to proceed to the consummation
at Pharescour.</p>

<p>The galleys which transported the Christian prisoners
arrived before that city. The king landed, with the princes,
his brothers, and was received in a pavilion, where he had
an interview with the sultan. History says nothing of this
conference between two princes, who equally commanded
attention, and whose position was so different; the one, intoxicated
by his victories, blinded by his prosperities; the
other, the conqueror of ill-fortune, coming out much greater
from the ordeal of adversity.</p>

<p>The two sovereigns had appointed Saturday, the eve of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
the Ascension, for the giving up of Damietta. According to
this convention, the Crusaders, who had been detained more
than a month in chains, had only to endure the pains of
captivity three days longer; but new misfortunes awaited
them, and their courage and resignation were doomed to
further trials. The day after their arrival before Pharescour,
the sultan of Cairo, in celebration of the peace, determined
to give a banquet to the principal officers of the
Mussulman army. The conspirators took advantage of this
opportunity, and, towards the end of the repast, all rushed
upon him, sword in hand. Bendocdar struck the first blow.
Almoadam, being only wounded in the hand, arises in a state
of terrified amazement, escapes through his motionless guards,
takes refuge in a tower, shuts the door of it, and appears at
a window, sometimes imploring succour, and sometimes
demanding of the conspirators what they required of him.
The envoy of the caliph of Bagdad was at Pharescour. He
mounted on horseback, but the Mamelukes threatened him
with instant death if he did not return to his tent. At the
same moment some drums were heard, giving the signal for
assembling the troops; but the leaders of the conspiracy told
the soldiers that Damietta was taken, and immediately the
whole army precipitated themselves upon the road to that
city, leaving the sultan at the mercy of men who thirsted for
his blood. The Mamelukes accuse and threaten him. He
endeavours to justify himself; but his words are drowned in
the tumult. A thousand voices cry out to him to descend;
he hesitates; he groans; he weeps; arrows fly against the
tower in showers; the Greek fire, hurled from every direction,
gives birth to a conflagration. Almoadam, nearly surrounded
by the flames, precipitates himself from the window; a nail
catches his mantle, and he remains for a moment suspended.
At length he falls to the earth; sabres and naked swords
wave over him on all sides; he casts himself on his knees,
at the feet of Octai, one of the principal officers of his guard,
who repulses him with contempt. The unhappy prince
arises, holding forth his imploring hands to all the assembly,
saying, that he was willing to abandon the throne of Egypt,
and would return into Mesopotamia. These supplications,
unworthy of a prince, inspire more contempt than pity;
nevertheless, the crowd of conspirators hesitate; but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
leaders know too well there can be no safety for them but
in completing the crime they have begun. Bendocdar, who
had inflicted the first blow, strikes him a second time with
his sabre; Almoadam, streaming with blood, throws himself
into the Nile, and endeavours to gain some vessels that appear
to be drawing near to the shore to receive him; nine
Mamelukes follow him into the water, and pour upon him
a thousand blows, within sight of the galley which Joinville
was on board of!<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p>

<p>Such was the end of Almoadam, who neither knew how
to reign nor how to die. Arabian authors point it out
as a remarkable circumstance, that he perished at once by
the sword, fire, and water. The same authors agree in
saying, that he himself provoked his ruin by his imprudence
and his injustice. But oriental history, accustomed
to laud success and blame all who succumb, repeats the
complaints of the Mamelukes without examining them;
and, passing lightly over this revolution, contents itself
with saying, “<i>When God wills an event, he prepares the
causes beforehand</i>.”</p>

<p>The Nile and its shore presented, at that moment, two
very different spectacles: on one side was a prince, whilst
revelling in all the pomps of grandeur, in all the triumphs
of victory, massacred by his own guards; on the other,
an unfortunate king, surrounded by his knights, as unfortunate
as himself, inspiring them with more respect in
his adversity than when he was encompassed with all the
splendour of prosperity and power. The French knights
and barons, although they had been victims of the barbarity
of the sultan, felt more astonishment than joy at the
sight of his tragical death; they could not comprehend
the murderous attack of the Mamelukes; and these revolutions
of military despotism, at war with itself, filled them
with dread.</p>

<p>After this sanguinary scene, thirty Saracen officers, sword
in hand and battle-axes on their shoulders, entered the galley
in which were the counts of Brittany and de Montfort,
Baldwin and Guy d’Ibelin, and the sieur de Joinville. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
furious men vomited imprecations, and threatening the
prisoners with both voice and gesture, made them believe
that their last hour was come. The Christian warriors prepared
themselves for death, and throwing themselves on their
knees before a monk of the Trinity, asked him for absolution
of their sins; but as the priest could not hear them all at
once, they confessed to each other. Guy d’Ibelin, constable
of Cyprus, confessed to Joinville, who gave him “such absolution
as God had given him the power to give.” It was thus,
in after-times, history represents the Chevalier Bayard,
wounded to death, and ready to expire, confessing himself
at the foot of an oak to one of his faithful companions in
arms.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p>

<p>But these menaces and violences of the emirs might have
a politic aim. At the conclusion of a conspiracy that had
divided men’s minds, in order to awaken fresh passions, it
was necessary for the leaders to excite the fanaticism of the
multitude, and direct the general fury against the Christians.
It was important for them to make others believe, and they
might have believed it themselves, that Almoadam had
endeavoured to find an asylum amongst the enemies of
Islamism.</p>

<p>The lords and barons did not meet with the fate they expected;
but as if their understanding with Almoadam had
been really dreaded, they were thrust into the hold of the
vessel, where they passed the night with the terrible images
of death constantly before their eyes.</p>

<p>Louis, shut up in his tent with his brothers, had heard
the tumult. In ignorance of what was passing, he concluded
that either they were massacring the French prisoners, or
else that Damietta was taken. He was a prey to a thousand
terrors, when he saw Octaï, the chief of the Mamelukes,
enter his tent. This emir ordered the guards to retire, and
pointing to his bloody sword, exclaimed: “Almoadam is no
more; what will you give me for having delivered you from
an enemy who meditated your destruction as well as ours?”
Louis made no reply. Then the furious emir, presenting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
the point of his sword, cried, “Dost thou not know that I
am master of thy person? Make me a knight, or thou art
a dead man.” “Make thyself a Christian,” replied the
monarch, “and I will make thee a knight.”<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> Without insisting
further, Octaï retired, and in a very short time the
tent of the king was filled with Saracen warriors, armed with
sabres and swords. Their demeanour, their cries, the fury
painted on their countenances, announced sufficiently that
they had just committed a great crime, and that they were
ready to commit others; but by a species of miracle, changing,
all at once, both countenance and language at the sight of
the king, they approached him with respect; then, as if they
felt in the presence of Louis the necessity for justifying
themselves, they told him that they had been forced to kill
a tyrant, who aimed at their destruction as well as that of
the Christians; now, they added, they had only to forget
the past; all they required for the future was the faithful
execution of the treaty concluded with Almoadam. Then
lifting their hands to their turbans, and bending their brows
to the ground, they retired in silence, and left the monarch
in a state of astonishment at seeing them thus pass, all at
once, from transports of rage to sentiments apparently the
most respectful.</p>

<p>This singular scene has made some historians say that the
Mamelukes offered the throne of Egypt to St. Louis. This
opinion has rather gained ground in our days, so easy is it
for us to give faith to everything that appears favourable to
the glory of the French name. The sieur de Joinville, who
is quoted in support of this assertion, only relates a conversation
he had held with Louis. The king asked him what
he thought he ought to have done, in case the emirs had
offered him the supreme authority. The good seneschal conceived
it was not possible to accept a crown from the hands
of those seditious emirs, who had killed their sovereign.
Louis was not of this opinion, and said that, truly, if they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
had proposed to him to become the successor of the sultan,
he would not in the least have refused to be so (<i>il ne l’eût
mie refusé</i>).<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> These words alone prove sufficiently that they
had proposed nothing to the captive monarch. Joinville, it
is true, adds to this recital, that according to reports that
were circulated in the Christian army, the emirs had caused
the trumpets to be sounded and the drums to be beaten
before the tent of the king of France, and that at the same
time they deliberated among themselves, whether it would
not be best to break the chains of their prisoner, and make
him their sovereign. The sieur de Joinville relates this fact,
without affirming it; and as oriental history preserves the
most profound silence upon it, an historian of the present
day cannot adopt it without compromising his veracity. It
is, without doubt, possible that the emirs might have expressed
the desire of having a prince amongst them possessed
of the firmness, bravery, and virtues of Louis IX.; but how
can it be believed that Mussulmans, animated by the double
fanaticism of religion and war, could have, for a moment,
entertained a thought of choosing an absolute master among
the Christians, whom they had just treated with unexampled
barbarity; and thus place their property, their liberty, their
lives in the hands of the most implacable enemies of their
country, their laws, and their faith?</p>

<p>The supreme power, of which the emirs had shown themselves
to be so jealous, and which they had wrested with so
much violence from the hands of Almoadam, appeared at
first to terrify their ambition, when they had it in their
power to dispose of it. In a council called to nominate a
sultan, the wisest declined to rule over a country filled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
troubles, or command an army given up to the spirit of
sedition. Upon their refusal, the crown was given to
Chegger-Eddour, who had had so great a share, first in the
elevation, and then in the fall of Almoadam. As governor
with her, in the quality of Atabec, they chose Ezz-Eddin
Aybek, who had been brought a slave into Egypt, and
whose barbarous origin procured him the surname of the
<i>Turcoman</i>.</p>

<p>The new sultana soon arrived at Pharescour, and was proclaimed
under the name of Mostassemieh Salehieh, queen of
the Mussulmans, mother of Malek-Almansor Khalil. Almansor
Khalil, a young prince, the son of Negmeddin, had preceded
his father to the tomb. Thus finished the powerful
dynasty of the Ayoubites, a dynasty founded by victory, and
overturned by an army which the pride of victory had rendered
seditious. Whilst they were thus forming a new
government, the body of Almoadam was abandoned on the
banks of the Nile, where it remained two days without sepulture.
The ambassador from the caliph of Bagdad at length
obtained permission to bury it, and deposited in an obscure
place the sad remains of the last successor of Saladin.</p>

<p>The elevation of Chegger-Eddour astonished the Mussulmans;
the name of a woman or of a slave had never till that
time been seen engraved upon the coins, or pronounced in
public prayers. The caliph of Bagdad protested against the
scandal of this innovation; and when he afterwards wrote to
the emirs, he asked them if they had not been able to find a
single man in all Egypt to govern them. The supreme
authority, placed in the hands of a woman, could neither
restrain the passions which troubled the empire, nor cause
treaties to be respected; which became very fatal to the
Christians, condemned to suffer by turns from the revolt and
the submission, from the union and the discord of their
enemies.</p>

<p>Among the emirs, some wished that the treaty concluded
with the sultan should be executed; whilst others were desirous
that a fresh one should be made: many were indignant
that the Christians should be treated with at all. After long
debates, they returned to that which had been done at first,
adding to it the condition that the king of France should
give up Damietta before he was set at liberty, and that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
should pay half of the sum agreed upon for the ransom of
himself and his army, before he left the banks of the Nile.
These last conditions announced the mistrust of the emirs,
and might give the Christian prisoners reason to fear that
the day of their deliverance was not yet arrived.</p>

<p>When the observance of the treaty was to be sworn to,
the forms of the oaths caused some discussion. The emirs
swore that if they failed in their promises, “they consented
to be jeered at like the pilgrim who makes the journey to
Mecca bareheaded; or else to be as much despised as he who
takes back his women after having left them.” The Mussulmans,
according to their manners and customs, had no more
solemn expression with which to guarantee their sworn faith.
They proposed to Louis IX. the following formula: “If I
keep not my oath, I shall be like to him who denies his God,
who spits upon the cross, and tramples it under-foot.” This
formula of the oath which they wished the king to take,
appeared to him to be an insult to God and himself. He
refused to pronounce it. In vain the emirs showed their
anger and their passion; he braved all their menaces. This
resistance of St. Louis, celebrated by his contemporaries,
will not perhaps obtain the same eulogies in the age we now
live in; nevertheless it must be considered that the king was
not only restrained on this occasion by the scruples of an exaggerated
devotion, but by a feeling of royal dignity. It may
be remembered, that in the third crusade, Richard and Saladin
had judged it unworthy of the majesty of kings to degrade
their word to the formula of an oath; and had been satisfied
with a touch of the hand, to cement the peace. Seditious
emirs, still stained with the blood of their master, might
undervalue the dignity of the supreme rank; but, on important
occasions, Louis never forgot he was a great king;
and the supposition of a perjury, the thought even of a
blasphemy, could not ally itself in his mind with the character
of a Christian prince and of a king of France.</p>

<p>The Mussulmans, irritated at seeing a king in fetters dictate
laws to them, and resist all their demands, began to talk
of putting him to death accompanied by tortures. “You
are masters of my body,” he replied, “but you have no power
over my will.” The princes, his brothers, implored him to
pronounce the required formula; but he was as firm against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
the entreaties of friendship and affection, as he had been
against the threats of his enemies. Even the exhortations
of the prelates had no more effect. At length the Mamelukes,
attributing such an obstinate resistance to the patriarch
of Jerusalem, seized this prelate, who was more than
eighty years of age, fastened him to a post, and tied his
hands behind him so tightly, that the blood sprang from
beneath the nails. The patriarch, overcome by the pain,
cried, “Sire! Sire! swear; I will take the sin upon myself.”
But Louis, who was throughout persuaded that they insulted
his good faith, and that they demanded of him a thing unjust
and dishonourable, remained immovable. The emirs, at
length subdued by so much firmness, consented to accept
the simple word of the king, and retired, saying that “this
Frank prince was the most haughty Christian that had ever
been seen in the East.”</p>

<p>All now gave their attention to the execution of the treaty.
The galleys, on board of which were the prisoners, heaved
their anchors, and descended towards the mouth of the Nile;
the Mussulman army accompanying them by land. The
Christians were to deliver up Damietta the next morning at
daybreak. It is impossible to describe the trouble, consternation,
and despair that reigned in the city throughout the
night. The unfortunate inhabitants ran about the streets,
asking each other questions, and communicating their fears
with breathless anxiety. The most sinister reports prevailed;
it was said that the whole of the Christian army had been
massacred by the Mussulmans, and that the king of France
was poisoned. When they received orders to evacuate the
place, most of the warriors declared aloud that they would
not obey, and that they preferred dying on the ramparts to
being slaughtered as prisoners of war.</p>

<p>At the same time excitement began to prevail in the
Mussulman army. It was whispered that the king of France
refused to execute the treaty, and that he had ordered the
garrison of Damietta to defend themselves. The soldiers
and their leaders repented of having made a truce with the
Franks, and appeared determined to take advantage of the
least pretext for breaking it.</p>

<p>The commissioners of Louis IX., however, at length persuaded
the Christians of Damietta to evacuate the city.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
Queen Marguerite, scarcely recovered from her confinement,
went on board a Genoese vessel. She was accompanied by
the duchess of Anjou, the countess of Poictiers, and the
unhappy widow of the count d’Artois, who, amidst present
calamities, still wept over the first misfortune of the war.
Towards the end of the night, Olivier de Thermes, who commanded
the garrison, the duke of Burgundy, the pope’s
legate, and all the Franks, except the sick that remained in
the city, embarked on the Nile.</p>

<p>Geoffrey de Sergines having entered Damietta, brought
the keys to the emirs; and when day broke, the Mussulman
standards were seen floating over the towers and ramparts.
At sight of this, the whole Egyptian army rushed tumultuously
into the city. The reports that had been circulated
during the night, had excited the fury of the soldiers, and
they entered Damietta as if the opening of the gates had
been the result of a sanguinary contest; they massacred the
sick wherever they found them, they pillaged the houses,
and gave to the flames the machines of war, the arms, and
all the munitions that belonged to the Christians.</p>

<p>This early violation of the treaty, the intoxication of carnage,
and the impunity of license, only served to inflame still
further the minds of the Mussulmans, and to lead them to
greater excesses. The emirs, partaking of the fury of the
soldiers, formed the idea of putting all the Christian prisoners
to death. The galleys in which the French barons and
knights were crowded, immediately received orders to reascend
the river towards Pharescour, “which caused great
grief amongst us,” says Joinville, “and many tears issued
from our eyes; for we all believed they were about to
kill us.”</p>

<p>Whilst the galleys re-ascended the Nile, the Mussulman
leaders deliberated in council upon the fate of the king of
France and the French warriors. “Now we are masters of
Damietta,” said one of the emirs, “and a powerful monarch
of the Franks, with the bravest of his warriors, may receive
from our hands death or liberty. Fortune offers us an
opportunity of securing peace to Egypt for ever, and with
it the triumph of Islamism. We have shed the blood of
Mussulman princes without scruple; why should we then
respect that of Christian princes, who have come into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
East to set fire to our cities and reduce our provinces to
slavery?” This opinion was that of the people and the
army; and most of the emirs, actuated by the general spirit,
held similar language. An emir of Mauritania, whose name
Joinville has not preserved, opposed, almost alone, this
violation of the laws of war and peace. “You have,” said
he, “put to death your prince, whom the Koran commands
you <i>to cherish as the apple of your eye</i>. This death might,
doubtless, be necessary for your own safety; but what can
you expect from the action that is proposed to you, except
the anger of God and the maledictions of men?” This
speech was interrupted by murmurs; the language of reason
only added heat to hatred and fanaticism. As violent
passions are never at a loss for motives of self-justification,
or for excuses for their excesses, the Crusaders were accused
of perfidy, treachery, and all the crimes that they themselves
contemplated against them. There was no imputation that
did not appear probable, consequently no violence that did
not appear just. “If the Koran ordered Mussulmans to
watch over the lives of their princes, it likewise commanded
them to watch over the preservation of the Mussulman
faith: death ought to be the reward of those who came to
bring death, and their bones ought to whiten upon the same
plains that they had laid waste. The safety of Egypt and
the laws of the prophet required that it should be so.”</p>

<p>After a very stormy deliberation, the terrible sentence of
the captives was about to be pronounced; but cupidity came
to the aid of justice and humanity;<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> the emir who had
spoken in favour of the Christian prisoners, had, in his
speech, more than once repeated the words, <i>Dead men pay no
ransom</i>; and they at length acknowledged that the sword,
by immolating the Crusaders, would only rob victory of its
dues, and deprive the conquerors of the fruit of their labours.
This observation at length calmed the minds of the assembly,
and brought about a change of opinions. The fear of
losing eight hundred thousand golden byzants caused the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
treaty to be respected, and saved the lives of the king of
France and his companions in misfortune.</p>

<p>The emirs issued orders for the galleys to be brought back
towards Damietta. The Mamelukes appeared, all at once,
to be governed by the most pacific sentiments; and, as it is
natural for the multitude to pass from one extreme to
another, they treated with all the attentions of hospitality
the very men whom, a few hours before, they had wished to
put to death. On their arrival before the city, the prisoners
were treated with fritters cooked in the sun, and with hard
eggs, “which,” says Joinville, “in honour of our persons,
were painted of various colours.”</p>

<p>The knights and barons at length had permission to leave
the ships that had been their prisons, to go and join the
king, whom many of them had not seen since the disaster of
Minieh. As they left their vessels, Louis was marching
towards the mouth of the Nile, escorted by Mussulman warriors;
an innumerable multitude followed him, and contemplated,
in silence, the features, the bearing, and the arms of
the Christian monarch. A Genoese galley awaited him; as
soon as he was on board, eighty archers, with their crossbows
strung, appeared suddenly upon the deck of the vessel;
the crowd of Egyptians immediately dispersed, and the ship
glided away from the shore. Louis had with him the count
of Anjou, the count de Soissons, Geoffrey de Sergines, Philip
de Nemours, and the seneschal de Joinville. The count of
Poictiers remained as a hostage in Damietta, until the payment
of the four hundred thousand golden byzants, which the
king ought to have paid to the emirs before he put to sea,
should be completed. Louis had not enough by thirty
thousand livres; this sum was requested of the Templars,
who, to the great scandal of the lords and barons, at first
refused it. They were threatened with being forced to furnish
it; and then complied. The amount stipulated in the
treaty was paid to the Saracens. The count of Poictiers
had left Damietta, and everything was ready for the departure
of the Crusaders, when Philip de Montfort, who had
been directed to make the payment, returned to give an
account of his mission, and told the king that he had contrived
to cheat the emirs out of ten thousand livres. Louis
expressed himself much dissatisfied with such a proceeding,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
and sent Philip de Montfort back to Damietta, to make restitution
of the money he had kept back&mdash;a lesson of justice
which he wished to give to both his enemies and his servants.
This last mission is spoken of by an Arabian author, who
attributes it to a very whimsical and singular motive. He
says that Philip de Montfort was sent to the emirs to tell
them that they were deficient in religion and good sense; in
religion, because they had murdered their sovereign; in good
sense, because, for a moderate sum, they had released a
powerful prince, who would have given half of his kingdom
to recover his liberty. This explanation, however improbable
it may be, at least serves to inform us of the opinion then
common in the East, that the Egyptian emirs were reproached
with having destroyed their sultan, and allowed their
enemy to escape.</p>

<p>Louis IX., with the miserable wreck of his army, soon
passed out at the mouth of the Nile, and in a few days
arrived at Ptolemaïs, where the people and the clergy were
still putting up prayers for his deliverance.</p>

<p>The Egyptians celebrated the restitution of Damietta
with public rejoicings; the Mussulman army broke up their
camp, and returned towards the capital. The sultana,
Chegger-Eddour, caused vests of gold and silver to be distributed
to the leaders, and her liberality even extended to
the soldiers. An Arabian poet composed some verses upon
this occasion, which history has preserved, and which contain
the remarkable passage that follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“When thou shalt see this Frenchman (the king of France), tell him
these words from the mouth of a sincere friend:</p>

<p>Thou camest into Egypt, thou covetedest its riches; thou believedst
that its powers would fade away as smoke.</p>

<p>Behold now thine army! see how thy imprudent conduct has precipitated
it into the bosom of the tomb!</p>

<p>Fifty thousand men! and not one that is not either killed, a prisoner,
or covered with wounds!</p>

<p>And if he should be ever tempted to come to avenge his defeat; if
any motive should bring him back to these places;</p>

<p>Tell him, that the house of the son of Lokman is reserved for him;
that he will still find there both his chains and the eunuch Sabyh.”<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Whilst Louis IX. was landing at Ptolemaïs, general consternation
prevailed in the West; as it always happens in
distant wars, fame had spread the most extraordinary reports
relative to the expedition of the Crusaders. At first it was
believed that the Christian standards were floating from the
walls of Cairo and Alexandria; but to these news other
rumours soon succeeded, announcing great disasters. The
most marvellous accounts had found plenty of credulous
minds in France to receive them; they refused to believe in
reverses, and the first who spoke of them were given up to
the hands of justice, as enemies of religion and of the kingdom.
The sinister reports, however, were not long in being
confirmed; the people passed from the excess of joy to the
excess of grief; there was not a family in the kingdom that
had not to deplore a loss in the disasters of which they
acquired the painful certainty. But for the French, that
which rendered so many misfortunes irreparable, and for
which no one could find consolation, was the captivity of the
king! Dances, festivals, spectacles,<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> everything that bore
the air of joy or pleasure, was forbidden: the kingdom,
plunged in sorrow and abasement, appeared, all at once, to
be like one of those cities of which the Scripture speaks,&mdash;threatened
with the wrath of God, they gave themselves up
to grief, and covered themselves with the mourning garb of
penitence.</p>

<p>The whole Church deplored so great a misfortune with
torrents of tears; the father of the faithful was nearly in
despair for the safety of Christendom. He addressed letters
filled with affliction to all the prelates of the West. He
ordered the clergy to put up public prayers; he exhorted the
faithful to take up arms. Innocent wrote to Blanche to
console her, and to Louis to sustain him in his adversity.
When addressing the king of France, he is astonished at
finding one man oppressed by so many calamities, and endowed
with so many virtues; and demands of God what
justice had been able to find in the most Christian of kings,
which deserved to be expiated by misfortunes so great.</p>

<p>England was likewise much afflicted by the captivity of
the French monarch; the barons and knights were indignant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
towards their king for having prevented them from going
into the East to share the perils of the Crusaders. The
King of Castile, then at war with the Moors, was sensible
only of the evils of the Christians beyond the seas, and
swore to go and fight with the victorious infidels on the
banks of the Nile or the Jordan. No monarch of the West
expressed more grief than Frederick II., emperor of Germany;
in his letters he spoke of the king of France as his
best friend, and deplored the disasters of the crusade with
bitterness. Frederick, still at variance with the pope, did
not neglect this opportunity of accusing Innocent, whom he
reproached with the ruin of the Christians. Frederick repaired
to Sicily, for the purpose of arming a fleet that might
convey prompt assistance to the Crusaders; and whilst the
vessels were getting ready, he sent an embassy into the East,
to solicit of the sultan of Egypt the deliverance of the king
of France and his army.</p>

<p>Amidst the universal desolation, a single Christian city
gave demonstrations of joy: Florence, according to Villani,
celebrated the reverses of the French Crusaders with festivities.
Some pirates from Genoa, Pisa, and Venice took
advantage of the disasters of Louis IX. to put to sea, and
pillage the Crusaders that were returning into Europe. The
joy of the Florentines, and the brigandages of the Italian
pirates, were subjects of great scandal for all Christendom.</p>

<p>Louis IX., on his arrival at Ptolemaïs, had only been able
to retain a small number of faithful knights; many of the
French nobles, the companions of his captivity, instead of
following him to Palestine, returned into the West. Among
those who had quitted the banner of the crusade, were the
duke of Burgundy and the brave count of Brittany: the
latter, worn out with sickness and covered with wounds, died
on his passage: his mortal remains, preserved by his knights,
were transported to the abbey of Villeneuve, near Nantes,
where, many ages afterwards, his tomb was still to be seen.</p>

<p>The appearance of the sad remains of the Christian army
must have excited the compassion of the inhabitants of
Ptolemaïs. Both knights and soldiers were almost naked;
the seneschal of Champagne, in order to appear at the king’s
table, was forced to make himself a vestment of the shreds
of a bed-quilt. An epidemic disease, the fruit of lengthened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
misery and all sorts of privations, broke out among the Crusaders,
and soon extended its ravages to the city. Joinville,
who was lodged in the house of the curé of Ptolemaïs, informs
us that he saw daily twenty convoys pass beneath his
windows; and that every time he heard the funeral words,
“<i>Libera me, Domine</i>” he burst into tears, and addressed himself
to God crying, <i>Mercy!</i></p>

<p>In the mean time the king of France was engaged in endeavouring
to deliver the captives that still remained in
Egypt. These captives amounted to twelve thousand, and
most of them might be able to resume their arms and serve
under the banner of the crusade. Louis sent his ambassadors
to pay the four hundred thousand francs that he still
owed to the Saracens, and to press the execution of the last
treaties. These ambassadors found Egypt filled with troubles;
the emirs were divided into several factions, all disputing for
power: fanaticism animated these divisions; they reciprocally
accused each other of having favoured or spared the
Christians. Amidst these debates, many captives had been
massacred, and some forced to abjure the faith of Christ.
The messengers of Louis IX. could scarcely obtain a hearing;
in answer to their demands, they were told that the king of
France might esteem himself fortunate in having regained
his liberty, and that the Mamelukes would soon go and
besiege him in Ptolemaïs. At length the Christian ambassadors
were obliged to quit Egypt without having obtained
anything; and only brought back to Palestine four hundred
prisoners, the greater part of whom had paid their own
ransom.</p>

<p>On their return, Louis IX. was plunged in the deepest
distress; he had just received a letter from Queen Blanche,
who exhorted him to leave the East. He, thereupon, was
desirous of returning to France; but how could he make up
his mind to abandon twelve thousand Christians in slavery,
or to quit the Holy Land when it was threatened with invasion?
The three military orders, the barons, and the
nobles of Palestine, conjured Louis not to abandon them;
repeating with accents of despair, that if they were deprived
of his support, the Christians of Syria would have no other
resource than to follow him into the West.</p>

<p>Louis was touched by their prayers, but before he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
form a resolution, he was desirous of consulting his two
brothers and the principal nobles that had remained with
him. He exhibited to them the reasons he had for returning
to France, and those that would lead him to remain in
Palestine: on the one side, his kingdom threatened by the
king of England, and the impossibility of his undertaking
anything against the infidels, ought to induce him to quit
the East; on the other side, the want of good faith in the
emirs, who had failed in executing the first conditions of the
treaty; the perils to which the Holy Land would be exposed
by his departure; the hope, in short, of receiving succours,
and profiting by them, to break the chains of the Christian
prisoners and deliver Jerusalem, in some sort, imposed upon
him the obligation to defer his return.</p>

<p>After having thus described the state of things, without
saying a word that might reveal his own opinion, he requested
his knights and barons to reflect seriously upon the line of
action it would be best for them to pursue. On the following
Sunday he again convoked them, and demanded their
opinion. The first that spoke was Guy de Malvoisin, whose
bravery in fight and wisdom in council were admired and respected
by all the Crusaders. “Sire,” said he, addressing
Louis, “when I consider the honour of your person and the
glory of your reign, I do not think you ought to remain
in this country. Remember that flourishing army with which
you left the ports of Cyprus, and then turn your eyes upon
the warriors you have with you; on that day we reckoned
two thousand eight hundred knights with banners in the
Christian army; now, one hundred knights constitute your
whole force; most of them are sick; they have neither arms
nor horses, nor the means of procuring any; they have not
the power of serving you with either honour or advantage.
You do not possess a single city of war in the East; that
in which you now are belongs to several different nations;
by remaining here, you inspire no fear in the infidels, and
you allow the audacity of your enemies in Europe to increase;
you expose yourself to the risk of losing both the kingdom
of France, where your absence may embolden ambitious
neighbours, and the kingdom of Jesus Christ, upon which
your presence will draw the attacks of the Mussulmans. We
are all persuaded that the pride of the Saracens should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
punished; but it is not in a country far distant from home
that the preparations for a decisive and glorious war can be
carried on. Thus, then, we advise you to return into the West,
where you will watch in safety over the welfare of your
states; where you will obtain, amidst a peace which is your
own work, the necessary means for avenging our defeats,
and, some day, repairing the reverses we have undergone.”</p>

<p>The duke of Anjou, the duke of Poictiers, and most of the
French nobles, who spoke after Guy de Malvoisin, expressed
the same opinion. When they came to the count of Jaffa, he
refused to speak, saying, “that he possessed several castles in
Palestine, and might be accused of defending his own personal
interests.” Upon being pressed by the king to give
his opinion as the others had done, he contented himself
with saying, “that the glory of the Christian arms, that the
safety of the land of Jesus Christ, required that the Crusaders
should not at that time return to Europe.” When it
came to Joinville’s turn, the good seneschal remembered
the advice that his cousin, the seigneur de Bollaincourt, had
given him on the eve of his departure for the crusade. “You
are going beyond the seas,”&mdash;it was thus the good seigneur
Bollaincourt expressed himself,&mdash;“but take care how you return;
no knight, either poor or rich, can come back without
shame, if he leaves any of the common people in whose company
he quits France in the hands of the Saracens.” Joinville,
full of the remembrance of these words, declared that
they could not abandon the great numbers of Christian
prisoners without shame. “These unhappy captives,” added
he, “were in the service of the king as well as in the service
of God; and never will they escape from their captivity if
the king should go away.” There was not one of the lords and
knights who had not either relations or friends among the
prisoners; therefore, many of them could not restrain their
tears whilst listening to Joinville; but this kindly feeling
was not sufficiently strong to stifle in their hearts their
desire to revisit their own country. In vain the seneschal
added that the king had still a portion of his treasure left;
that he could raise troops in the Morea and other countries;
and that with the succours which would come from Europe,
they should soon be in a condition to renew the war. These
reasons, with many others, made no impression upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
greater part of the assembly: they could only view the crusade
as a long and painful exile. The sieur de Chastenai,
and Beaumont marshal of France, were all that agreed with
the opinion of Joinville. “What shall we reply,” said they,
“to those who shall ask us on our return what we have done
with the heritage and the soldiers of Jesus Christ? Listen
to the unfortunate inhabitants of Palestine: they accuse us
of having brought war to them, and reproach us with preparing
their entire ruin by our departure. If we do not
receive succours, it will be then time enough to go; but why
anticipate days of despair? The Crusaders, it is true, are
not in great numbers; but can we forget that their leader,
even when in chains, made himself respected by the Saracens?
Report, likewise, tells us, that discord prevails among
our enemies, and that the sultan of Damascus has declared
war against the Mamelukes of Egypt.” These two knights
spoke amidst the murmurs of their companions; and the more
reasonable the opinions they advanced appeared, the greater
was the impatience with which they were listened to. The
seigneur de Beaumont was about to continue; but he was
interrupted with great warmth by his uncle, John de Beaumont,
who loaded him with the most bitter reproaches. In
vain the king urged the right that every one had to express
his opinion; authority of blood prevailed over the authority
of the king; the stern old man continued to raise his voice,
and reduced his nephew to silence. When he had received
the opinions of the assembly, the king dismissed them, and
convoked them again for the following Sunday. Upon leaving
the council, Joinville found himself exposed to the railleries
and insults of the knights, for having expressed an opinion
contrary to that of the general meeting. To complete his
chagrin, he thought he had incurred the displeasure of the king;
and in his despair, he formed the resolution of joining the
prince of Antioch, his relation. As he was revolving these
gloomy thoughts in his mind, the king took him aside,
and opening his heart to him, declared that it was his
intention to remain some time longer in Palestine. Then
Joinville forgot all the scoffs of the barons and knights; he
was so joyous with what the king had told him, that all his
griefs were at an end. On the following Sunday the barons
assembled for the third time. The king of France invoked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
the inspiration of the Holy Ghost by a sign of the cross,
and pronounced the following words:&mdash;“Seigneurs, I thank
equally those who have advised me to remain in Asia, and
those who have advised me to return to the West. Both, I
am convinced, had no other view but the interest of my
kingdom and the glory of Jesus Christ. After the most
serious and lengthened reflection, I think I may, without
injury or peril to my states, prolong my sojourn in this
country. The queen, my mother, has defended the honour
of my crown in troublesome times; she will now exhibit the
same firmness, and will meet with fewer obstacles. No, my
kingdom will not suffer by my absence; but if I quit this
land, for which Europe has made so many sacrifices, who
will protect it against its enemies? Is it to be wished, that,
having come here to defend the kingdom of Jerusalem, I
shall be hereafter reproached with its ruin? I remain then to
save that which is left, to deliver our prisoners, and if possible,
to take advantage of the discords of the Saracens. I am
not willing, however, to impose restraint upon anybody;
such as are desirous of quitting the East are free to depart;
as to those who shall determine to remain beneath
the banners of the cross, I promise that they shall want
for nothing, and that I will ever share with them both
good and ill fortune.”</p>

<p>After these words, says Joinville, most were astonished,
and many began to shed hot tears. From that time, the
dukes of Anjou and Poictiers, with a great number of the
leaders, made preparations for their departure. Louis
charged them with a letter addressed to the clergy, the
nobility, and people of his kingdom. In this letter, Louis
described, with a noble simplicity, the victories, defeats, and
captivity of the Christian knights, and conjured his subjects
of all classes to take up arms for the assistance of the Holy
Land.</p>

<p>As soon as the two brothers of the king were gone, a levy
of soldiers was commenced, and Palestine was placed in a
state of defence. But that which most materially favoured
the Crusaders, and gave a chance of security to the Christian
colonies, was the discord that then prevailed among the
Saracens. After the murder of Almoadam, the Mussulmans
of Syria refused to recognise the authority of the Mamelukes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
The principality and city of Damascus had recently
been given up to Nasser, who was preparing to march
against Cairo, at the head of a formidable army; the greatest
agitation reigned amongst the Mamelukes of Egypt, in
whom remorse seemed to be accompanied by fear. The
sultana, Chegger-Eddour, was forced to descend from the
throne, and to yield the supreme authority to the Turcoman
Ezz-Eddin, whose wife she had become. This change allayed
agitation for a time; but in such a state of things, one
revolution seemed immediately to bring on another. The
turbulent, restless soldiery, that had overthrown the empire
of the Ayoubites, could neither endure that which was
ancient, nor that which was new. To suppress sedition, the
leaders at one time exhibited to the multitude a child of
that family which they had proscribed, and decorated him
with the vain title of sultan. They afterwards declared that
Egypt belonged to the caliph of Bagdad, and that they
governed it in his name.</p>

<p>It was at this period that the sultan of Aleppo and
Damascus sent ambassadors to Louis IX. to invite the
French monarch to unite with him to chastise the pride and
the revolt of the soldiery of Cairo. He promised the Christians
to share with them the spoils of the conquered, and to
restore to them the kingdom of Jerusalem. These brilliant
promises were likely to produce an effect upon the king of
France, and at least merited all his attention. The emirs
of Egypt equally solicited the alliance of the Christians,
and proposed very advantageous conditions. In the choice
before him, there were powerful motives to incline the king
to the party of the sultan of Damascus. He had, on one
side, to treat with emirs whose good-will was very uncertain,
whose fortune might be transitory, and whose authority
was menaced and tottering. On the other, he had to deal
with a powerful prince, whose authority being much better
established, offered a more sure guarantee to his allies.
Another motive, which could not be indifferent in the
eyes of the virtuous monarch, was, that the only aim of
the policy of the Mamelukes was to secure impunity for
a great crime, and that the sovereign of Damascus was
aiming to avenge the cause of princes. All these considerations
were, no doubt, presented in the council of Louis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
and must have left the monarch great difficulty in deciding
which side it would be best for him to take. But he could
not forget that he had signed a treaty with the emirs, and
that nothing could liberate him from his oath; but above
all, he could not forget that the Mamelukes still held in
their hands the destiny of twelve thousand Christian prisoners,
and that by breaking with them, he should renounce
the hope of delivering the unhappy companions of his captivity.
Louis answered the Syrian ambassadors, that he
would willingly join his arms to those of the sultan of
Damascus, if the Mamelukes did not perform their treaties.
At the same time, he sent John de Valence to Cairo, with
directions to offer the emirs peace or war. The latter promised
at length to fulfil all the conditions of the treaty, if
Louis should consent to become their ally and auxiliary:
more than two hundred knights were immediately set at
liberty.</p>

<p>These unfortunate victims of the crusade arrived at Ptolemaïs
about the month of October (1251): the people
flocked in crowds to see them land; they exhibited too evident
signs of their late captivity, and the remembrance of
what they had undergone, together with their present
wretchedness, drew tears of compassion from all the spectators.
These prisoners, whose chains Louis had succeeded
in breaking, brought with them, in a kind of triumph, a
coffin, containing the bones of Gauthier de Brienne, who
fell into the hands of the infidels at the battle of Gaza, and
had been massacred by a furious mob at Cairo. The clergy
accompanied the remains of the Christian hero to the
church of the Hospitallers; and the companions in arms of
Gauthier described his exploits and the glorious death he
had undergone for the cause of Christ. Religion displayed
all its pomps, and in its holy songs celebrated the glory of
a martyr, and the devotion that it alone had inspired. The
charity of the faithful relieved and consoled the misery of
the captives, and Louis took into his service all whom age
or infirmities rendered incapable of bearing arms.</p>

<p>The king learnt with much pain that many Christian prisoners
still remained in Egypt. As the Egyptian ambassadors
arrived at that time at Ptolemaïs, Louis IX. declared
that they must not at all depend upon the alliance they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
came to solicit, if the emirs did not hasten to liberate all the
captives and all the children of Christians brought up in the
Mussulman faith, and even send to him the heads of the
Crusaders that had been exposed upon the walls of Cairo.</p>

<p>Thus the position of the Christians was ameliorated daily
by the divisions among their enemies. The king of France
dictated the conditions to the emirs, and if he had had
troops, he might have repaired some of the reverses he had
experienced in Egypt; but the East furnished him with but
a very small number of soldiers, and the West did not seem
at all disposed to send him any supplies.</p>

<p>The king of Castile, who had taken the cross, died at
the moment he was preparing to set out. In England,
Henry III., who had likewise assumed the cross, obtained
from the pope and the parliament the power to levy a
tenth upon his people and clergy; he at the same time
imposed enormous taxes upon the Jews of his kingdom.
The preachers of the crusade were directed to announce his
approaching departure for the East, and he himself swore
upon the Gospel, in the presence of the assembled barons
and people, that he would go to the Holy Land, at the head
of his army; but after having obtained what he wanted, he
forgot all his promises.</p>

<p>Frederick II., at the moment he was about to assist
Louis IX., died at Naples; and his death proved to be a
fresh source of trouble and agitation for Christendom. Although
he had, when dying, bequeathed a hundred thousand
ounces of gold for the succour of the Holy Land, and by
his testament had restored to the Church all that had
belonged to it, Innocent received the news of his death
with a joy that he did not seek to conceal. “Let the
Heavens rejoice!” wrote he to the clergy and people of Sicily;
“let the earth be in gladness!” and he pursued with anathemas
the memory of a prince who had borne the title of king of
Jerusalem during thirty-eight years. He excommunicated
Conrad, whom Frederick had named as his successor to the
empire; he sent emissaries into the kingdom of Naples, to
corrupt the fidelity of the people; and ecclesiastics in Germany
received the mission to preach a crusade against the
princes of the house of Swabia.</p>

<p>France was not less agitated than other countries on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
return of the dukes of Anjou and Poictiers, the letter of
Louis addressed to his subjects was read in all the churches.
This letter revived all the sorrow that had been felt when
the account was received of the captivity of the king and
his army. The exhortations which Louis addressed to the
French to obtain assistance, together with the news that
arrived daily from the East, affected all hearts; and as the
people have no idea of moderation in either grief or joy, a
spirit of sedition, mixed with enthusiasm for the crusade,
agitated the cities, pervaded the provinces, and, for a time,
placed the kingdom in peril.</p>

<p>Princes and magnates having failed in their enterprise,
the multitude was led to believe that Christ rejected the
great ones of the earth from his service, and was only willing
to have for defenders humble men, shepherds, and labourers.
A man appeared, who undertook, with the help of this
popular opinion, to inflame the public mind, and to create a
general movement. This man, named Jacob, born in Hungary,
and far advanced in age, was said to have preached the
crusade of children, of which we have spoken in the twelfth
book of this work. A long beard, which descended to his
girdle, with a pale face and mysterious language, gave him
the air of a prophet. He passed from hamlet to hamlet,
saying that he was sent by Heaven to deliver the city of
God, and avenge the king of France. Shepherds left their
flocks, labourers laid down the plough to follow his footsteps.
Jacob, who was called the master of Hungary, caused a
standard to be borne before him, upon which was painted
a lamb, the symbol of the Saviour of the world; provisions
were brought to him from all parts, and his disciples asserted
that, like Christ, he had the gift of multiplying loaves.</p>

<p>The name of <i>Pastors</i> was given to these village Crusaders.
Their first meetings, to which little attention was paid, were
held in the provinces of Flanders and Picardy; they then
directed their course towards Amiens, and afterwards towards
the capital; increasing as they went, with a crowd of vagabonds,
thieves, and prostitutes. Although they had committed
some disorders, Queen Blanche tolerated them, in the
hope they might be the means of procuring some assistance
for the king. The implied protection of the queen regent
inflamed their pride, and impunity increased their license<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
and redoubled their audacity. The impostor Jacob and the
other heads of his gang, with whom chance or corruption had
associated him, declaimed with vehemence against the wealth
and the supremacy of the clergy, which pleased the multitude
they drew at their heels; to the great scandal of all
pious men, they themselves performed sacerdotal functions,
and took the place, in the pulpits, of the sacred orators, employing
violence against the ministers of the altars, and
seeking to awaken the passions of the people. At length,
assembled to the number of more than a hundred thousand,
these redoubtable pilgrims left Paris, and divided themselves
into several troops, to repair to the coast, whence they were
to embark for the East. The city of Orleans, which happened
to be in their passage, became the theatre of frightful
disorders. The progress of their enormities at length
created serious alarm in the government and the magistracy;
orders were sent to the provinces to pursue and disperse
these turbulent and seditious bands. The most numerous
assemblage of the pastors was fixed to take place at Bourges,
where the master of Hungary was to perform miracles and
communicate the will of Heaven. Their arrival in that city
was the signal for murder, fire, and pillage. The irritated
people took up arms and marched against these disturbers
of the public peace; they overtook them between Mortemer
and Villeneuve-sur-le-Cher, where, in spite of their numbers,
they were routed, and received the punishment due to their
brigandages. Jacob had his head cut off by the blow of an
axe; many of his companions and disciples met with death
on the field of battle, or were consigned to punishment; the
remainder took to flight.<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></p>

<p>Thus this storm, formed so suddenly, was dispersed in the
same manner; another band, which had directed its course
towards Bordeaux, was likewise subdued; some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
pastors who succeeded in getting to England, were served in
the same way. A report was spread that correspondences
with the Saracens had been found upon the persons of their
leaders, and they were accused of having formed the project
of delivering up Christian people to the swords of the infidels;
which accusation, however improbable, completed the
hatred the people began to entertain for them. The government,
which had not at first strength enough to oppose
them, armed the passions of the multitude against them,
and tranquillity was soon reëstablished in the kingdom.</p>

<p>In the mean time the crusade to the East was preached in
most of the countries of Europe; new indulgences were
added to those which had been accorded to the soldiers of
Christ; the bishop of Avignon received power to absolve
those who had struck clerks, or burnt churches; the same
bishop had the faculty of converting all vows, except that of
religion, into a vow for the crusade: similar powers were
given to the prior of the Jacobins at Paris. These new
encouragements might have aroused a momentary ardour in
the faithful, if the court of Rome had not been constantly
diverted from the cares of a crusade in the East, by the war
it had declared against the house of Swabia. The Holy See
willingly granted dispensations to Crusaders who took a
part in its cause, or who paid it a tribute; which made the
good bishop of Lincoln accuse Innocent of exchanging the
treasures of heaven for those of earth, and of selling the
Crusaders as the heifers and rains of sacrifice were formerly
sold in the Temple. At length, no longer concealing either
his hatred or his ambition, the sovereign pontiff ordered the
Cordeliers to preach a crusade against the heir and successor
of Frederick; the indulgence for those who took the cross
extended to the father and mother of the Crusaders, a thing
that had never taken place in any other crusade. At the
moment when Louis IX. was so earnestly requesting succour,
the preaching of this impious crusade excited great
scandal among the French nobility; the new Crusaders were
treated as rebels; Queen Blanche caused their lands to be
seized; and the princes and lords followed the example of
the queen in their domains. The Cordeliers were severely
reprimanded, and their preaching proved ineffectual.</p>

<p>Whilst the crusade against Conrad was being suppressed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
no increased zeal was exhibited for the war in the East.
Those who entertained the warmest attachment for Louis IX.
might with justice believe, that by sending him assistance
they should prolong his absence. Thus, in spite of the
reiterated prayers of the king, France, which had shed so
many tears over his captivity, could not resolve to take up
arms to succour him, and was satisfied with putting up vows
for his return.</p>

<p>All that Blanche was able to do for her son was to send
him a vessel laden with money, which was lost on the coast
of Syria. A small number of those who had taken the cross
in the West, determined to cross the sea; the young count
of Eu, and Raymond count of Turenne, whom the queen
commanded to set out for Palestine, were almost the only
nobles of this party. Most of the knights and barons that
had remained in Palestine with the king, having spent
everything, and being entirely ruined, fixed so high a price
upon their services, and, according to the expression of the
commissaries of Louis, <i>made themselves so dear</i>, that the
treasury of the monarch would not suffice to support them.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>
Levies were made in Greece, in Cyprus, and in the Christian
cities of Syria; but these levies only brought to the banners
of the crusade a few adventurers, very ill calculated to share
the labours and dangers of a great enterprise.</p>

<p>Among the warriors whom the love of danger and distant
adventures led at this time to the Holy Land, history speaks
of Alemar of Selingan. This knight had come from a country
of the West,<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> in which the summer, he said, had almost no
nights. Selingan and his companions sought every opportunity
for signalizing their skill in arms and their romantic
bravery. Whilst waiting for the happy moment, at which
they might fight with the Saracens, they made war upon the
lions, which they pursued on horseback into the deserts, and
killed with their arrows; which was a subject of great surprise
and admiration for the French warriors.</p>

<p>Another very noble knight also arrived, says Joinville,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
who was called De Toucy. The chevalier de Toucy had been
regent of the Latin empire of Constantinople, in the absence
of Baldwin, and prided himself upon belonging to the family
of the kings of France. In company with nine other
knights, he abandoned an empire which was falling rapidly
to ruin, in order to endeavor to support the miserable remains
of the kingdom of Jerusalem. Toucy related the
misfortunes of Baldwin, and the deplorable circumstances
that had forced a Christian emperor to ally himself with a
chief of the Comans. According to the custom of the barbarians,
the prince of the Comans and the emperor of Constantinople
had punctured themselves, and mixing the blood
in a cup, had both drunk of it, as a sign of alliance and
brotherhood. The knights who accompanied the seigneur
de Toucy had borrowed this practice of the barbarians: the
French warriors at first were disgusted with it; but soon,
led away by the strange novelty of the thing, they themselves
mingled their blood with that of their companions,
and diluting it with floods of wine, they got intoxicated
together over the mystical draught, which, as they said,
made them brothers.</p>

<p>The manners and customs of the Eastern nations strongly
raised the curiosity and fixed the attention of the Crusaders.
When the missionaries whom Louis IX. had sent into Tartary
returned to Ptolemaïs, the French warriors were never
tired of interrogating and listening to them. Andrew de Lonjumeau,
who was at the head of the mission, had set out
from Antioch, and travelling ten leagues every day, had
prosecuted his journey for a year before he arrived at the
place at which the great khan of the Tartars resided. The
missionaries traversed deserts where they met with enormous
heaps of human bones&mdash;sad monuments of the victories of
a barbarous people: they related marvellous things of the
court of the monarch of the Moguls, of the manners and
customs of the countries they had travelled through, of the
conquests and legislation of Gengiskhan, and of the prodigies
which had prepared the power and greatness of the conqueror
of Asia. Among the extraordinary and somewhat
fabulous circumstances they related, the Christians learned
with much joy that the religion of Christ was extending its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
empire among the most distant nations; the missionaries
declared they had seen, in a single horde of Tartars, more
than eight hundred chapels, in which the praises of the true
God were celebrated. Louis IX. hoped that the Moguls
might some day become auxiliaries of the Christians in the
great struggle against the infidels; and this hope made him
resolve to send fresh missionaries into Tartary.</p>

<p>But if the Crusaders were thus astonished at all they
heard concerning the most distant regions of Asia, they had
close to them a barbarous colony which must have excited
their surprise to a still greater degree. Some months after
his arrival, Louis received an embassy from the Old Man of
the Mountains, who, as we have already said, reigned over
about thirty villages or towns, built on the southern declivity
of Mount Libanus. The envoys of the prince of the Assassins,
when admitted into the presence of the king of France,
asked him if he was acquainted with their master. “I have
heard of him,” replied the monarch. “Why, then,” added
one of the ambassadors, “have you not sought after his
friendship by sending him presents, as the emperor of Germany,
the king of Hungary, the sultan of Cairo, and so
many other great princes have done?” The king listened
to this strange language without anger, and appointed the
ambassadors another audience, at which the grand masters of
the Templars and the Hospitallers were present. The name
alone of the two military orders, which the poniard of the
Assassins did not venture to attack, inspired some degree of
terror in the Old Man of the Mountain, who had been constrained
to pay them a tribute. In the second audience, the
two grand masters sternly reproved the ambassadors, and
told them that if the lord of the Mountain did not send
presents to the king of France, his insolence would draw
upon him a prompt and just chastisement. The envoys
repeated these threatening words to their master, who himself
experienced some of the fear he wished to inspire, and
sent them back to Louis to express much more pacific sentiments.
Among the presents which they were charged to
offer to the king of the Franks, there were several vases, a
chess-board, and an elephant in rock crystal; to these the
lord of the Mountain added a shirt and a ring, as symbols<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
of alliance, according to which, said the envoys to the
French monarch, “you and our master will remain united
as the fingers of the hand are, and as the shirt is to the
body.”<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></p>

<p>Louis IX. received this new embassy with distinction, and
by their hands sent to the prince of the Assassins vases of
gold and silver, and stuffs of scarlet and silk; he commanded
brother Yves, a man learned in Arabic, to accompany them.
Yves, who remained for some time at the court of the Old
Man of the Mountain, on his return related many curious
particulars, which history has not despised. The prince of
the Assassins belonged to the sect of Ali, and professed
some admiration for the Gospel. He had, in particular, a
veneration for <i>Monseigneur St. Peter</i>, who, according to his
belief, was still living, and whose soul, he said, had been
successively that of Abel, Noah, and Abraham. Brother
Yves spoke strongly of the terror with which the Old Man
of the Mountain inspired his subjects. A fearful silence
reigned around his palace, and when he appeared in public,
he was preceded by a herald-at-arms, who cried with a loud
voice, “Whoever you may be, dread to appear before him
who holds the life and death of kings in his hands.”</p>

<p>Whilst these marvellous recitals were amusing the leisure
of the Crusaders, war was declared between the sultans of
Damascus and Cairo. The Christian warriors, impatient
for fight, sighed at being thus condemned to waste their
time in listless idleness. But they mustered scarcely seven
hundred knights beneath the banners of the cross; and
their small number would not permit Louis to think of
attempting any important enterprise.</p>

<p>Whilst anxiously looking forward to the perils and hazards
of war, the holy monarch never relaxed in his endeavours to
ameliorate the destiny and break the chains of the captives
who still remained in the hands of the Mussulmans. But
the captivity of the Christian warriors was not the only
grief with which his heart was afflicted: it added greatly to
his sorrow to learn that many of his companions in arms
had embraced Islamism. It is a singular circumstance to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
remark,<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> that the Crusaders, whose aim always was to bring
about the triumph of Christianity, present us with frequent
examples of apostasy, and history does not hesitate to affirm,
that during the course of the holy wars more Christians became
Mussulmans than Mussulmans became Christians. Joinville
informs us in his Memoirs, that most of the mariners who
manned the Christian fleet in the retreat from Mansourah,
renounced their faith to save their lives: in these disastrous
days, many warriors were unable to resist the menaces of the
Saracens, and the fear of death made them forget a religion
for which they had taken up arms. We have seen what
evils the Crusaders had endured in the expeditions to the
East; among the crowd of pilgrims there were always some
who had not sufficient virtue to pass through the ordeal of
great misfortunes: on the arrival of Louis IX. in Egypt,
that country already contained many of these perjured and
unfaithful Christians, who, in the perils and calamities of
preceding wars, had forsaken the God of their fathers. All
these renegadoes were despised by the Saracens. Oriental
authors quote a saying of Saladin’s on this subject, which
expresses an opinion generally established, and which was
maintained to the very last days of the crusades; he said
that <i>a good Christian was never made of a bad Mussulman,
nor a good Mussulman of a bad Christian</i>. History affords
a few details upon the lives of these degenerate Franks, who
had renounced their religion and their country; many employed
themselves in agriculture and the mechanical arts; a
great number were enrolled in the Mussulman armies; some
obtained employments, and succeeded in amassing great
wealth. We may well, however, believe, that remorse empoisoned
every moment of their lives, and would not permit
them to enjoy the advantages they had acquired among the
infidels:<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> the religion they had quitted still inspired them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
with respect, and the presence and language of the Franks,
who had been their brothers, recalled to them the most saddening
remembrances; but, withheld by I know not what
false shame, and as if God had struck them with an eternal
reprobation, they remained chained to their error by an
invincible link, and although sensible of the misery of living
in a foreign land, they did not dare to entertain the idea of
returning to their own country.</p>

<p>One of these renegadoes, born at Provins, who had fought
under the banners of John of Brienne, came to salute
Louis IX., and bring him presents, at the moment the
monarch was embarking on the Nile, to repair to Palestine.
As Joinville told him, that if he persisted in practising the
religion of Mahomet, <i>he would go straight to hell after his
death</i>; he replied, that he believed the religion of Christ to
be better than that of the prophet of Mecca; but, he added,
that if he returned to the faith of the Christians, he should
sink into poverty, and that during the rest of his life he
should be loaded with infamous reproaches, and be everywhere
hooted as a renegado! a renegado! Thus, the fear of
poverty, together with a dread of the judgments of the
world, held fast the deserters from the Christian faith, and
prevented their return to the belief they had abandoned.
Louis IX. neglected no means to bring them back to the
right path; his liberality always met half-way such as were
disposed to revert to Christianity; and to shield them, from
the contempt of men, he issued an ordinance that none
should reproach them with their apostasy.</p>

<p>The king of France expended considerable sums in placing
several of the Christian cities in a state of defence; the
towers and walls of Cæsarea, as well as those of Ptolemaïs,
were heightened and enlarged; the walls and fortifications
of Jaffa and Caïpha, which were almost in ruins, were repaired.
Amidst these useful labours, carried on in peace,
the warriors remained idle, and not a few of them began to
be forgetful of both military discipline and Gospel morality.
The precaution that the sieur de Joinville took to place his
bed in such a manner as to remove all evil thoughts respecting
his familiarity with women, proves that the morals of
the Christian knights were not entirely free from suspicion
at least. Louis was much more severe against licentiousness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
of manners than he had been during his abode at Damietta.
History mentions several instances of his severity; and such
was the strangeness of the penal laws charged with the
protection of public decency and morality, that excess of
libertinism would at the present day appear less scandalous
than the punishments then inflicted on the guilty.</p>

<p>The clergy, however, never relaxed in their endeavours to
recall the Crusaders to the principles of the Christian religion;
and their efforts were not fruitless. There was no city,
no place in Palestine, that did not remind the warriors of
the holy traditions of the Scriptures, or of the mercy and
justice of God. Many of the French nobles, who had been
models of courage, showed an equally bright example of
devotion and piety; it was common to see the bravest
knights lay down their arms, and assuming the scrip and
staff of the pilgrim, repair to the spots consecrated by the
miracles and the presence of Christ and the holy personages
whose memory is preserved by religion. Louis himself
visited Mount Thabor and the village of Cana several times,
and went on a pilgrimage to Nazareth. The sultan of Damascus,
who sought every opportunity of forming an alliance
with him, invited him to come as far as Jerusalem; and this
pilgrimage would have crowned the wishes of the pious
monarch; but his barons, and more particularly the bishops,
represented to him that it was not befitting for him to enter
Jerusalem as a simple pilgrim, and that he had come into
the East not only to visit, but to deliver the holy tomb.
They added, that the Western princes who should take the
cross after him, would believe, from his example, that they
had fulfilled their duty, and performed their vow, by merely
visiting the holy city; and thus the devotion of the Crusaders
would no longer have the deliverance of the sepulchre of
Christ for its object. Louis IX. yielded to the representations
of the prelates, and consented not to visit Jerusalem
at that time, as he still cherished the hope of one day entering
it sword in hand. But this hope was doomed soon to
fade away&mdash;God never afterwards permitted the holy city
to be wrested from the yoke of the infidels.</p>

<p>The sultans of Cairo and Damascus continued to negotiate
with the monarch of the Franks. Each of these two
Mussulman princes hoped to have the Christians for allies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
and was particularly anxious not to have them for enemies.
Every time they entertained a fear of being vanquished, the
emirs of Egypt renewed their proposals, and they at length
accepted all the conditions that the Christians required. A
treaty was concluded, by which the Mamelukes engaged to
liberate all the captives that remained in Egypt, the children
of Christians brought up in the Mussulman faith, and,
which had often been demanded by Louis, the heads of the
martyrs of the cross that had been exposed upon the walls
of Cairo. Jerusalem and all the cities of Palestine, with
the exception of Gaza, Daroum, and two other fortresses,
were to be placed in the hands of the Franks. The treaty
likewise stipulated that, during fifteen years, the kingdom of
Jerusalem should have no war with Egypt; that the two
states should combine their forces; and that all conquests
should be shared between the Christians and the Mamelukes.
Some ecclesiastics expressed their doubts and scruples upon
an alliance with the enemies of Christ; but the pious
monarch disdained to notice their representations; no treaty
had ever offered so many advantages for the Christian cause,
if good faith had presided over its execution: but the
generous loyalty of Louis rendered him incapable of suspecting
fraud or perfidy in his allies, or even in his
enemies.</p>

<p>The leaders of the Mussulmans were to repair to Gaza,
and from thence to Jaffa, to confirm the alliance they had
just contracted, and to arrange with the French king the
plan for carrying on the war. When the sultan of Damascus
heard of the treaty thus entered into, he sent an army
of twenty thousand men to take a position between Gaza
and Daroum, so as to prevent the junction of the Egyptians
and Franks. Whether the Mamelukes were prevented by
their internal divisions, or whether they did not dare to face
the troops of Damascus, they did <i>not</i> appear at Jaffa at the
time agreed upon. They, however, fulfilled all the other conditions
of the treaty, and added to the convoy of captives and
funereal relics, the present of an elephant, which Louis sent
to Henry III. of England. As they often repeated their
promise of coming to Jaffa, Louis was constantly in expectation
of them, and waited for them an entire year. The
French monarch being thus deceived in his hopes, might,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
without injustice, have renounced a treaty that the other contracting
party did not execute; he might again have opened a
communication with the sultan of Damascus, who offered the
same advantages, with much more probability of his promises
being fulfilled. The emirs of Egypt had sought the alliance
of the Christians when their own situation appeared desperate,
and when they had reason to believe that the king of
France would receive succours from the West; seeing, however,
that Louis had no army, and that all the forces he
could muster did not amount to more than seven hundred
knights, they were fearful of entering too deeply into engagements
that would expose them to the hatred of the
Mussulmans, without offering them any substantial support
against their enemies. All these emirs besides, only fought
to secure for themselves impunity for their crime, and to be
left in quiet possession of the fruits of their revolt. They
were at all times ready to lay down their arms, if they procured
pardon for the past, and had Egypt abandoned to
them. The caliph of Bagdad was always anxious to establish
peace among the Mussulman powers; he prevailed upon
the sultan of Damascus and Aleppo to forget his causes of
resentment, and upon the emirs of Egypt to express repentance,
with a desire for peace. Several battles were
fought without any decisive results; in one of these battles
a party of Syrian troops were defeated by the Mamelukes,
and fled away towards Damascus; whilst other
bodies of Mamelukes were beaten by the Syrians, and pursued
up to the gates of Cairo. A war in which victory was
always uncertain, necessarily weakened the courage and
exhausted the patience of both parties; and they appealed to
the spiritual father of the Mussulmans to arbitrate between
them. The sultans of Syria and Egypt at length concluded
a peace, and agreed to unite their arms against the Christians.
From that time the hopes of the Crusaders all
vanished; the king of France, from having procrastinated
so long, and at the same time neglected a favourable
opportunity, had, all at once, two united enemies to dread.
It is necessary to be perfectly acquainted with the situation
and policy of the Mussulman powers, to ascertain how far
history has reason to blame the indecision and tardiness of
Louis IX. Le père Maimbourg does not scruple to blame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
him with much severity, and declares plainly, <i>that to be a
saint, it appears not necessary to be infallible, particularly in
political affairs, and even still less in those of war</i>.</p>

<p>The treaty concluded between the Mamelukes and Syrians
was the signal for war; the sultan of Damascus, at the head
of an army, came under the very walls of Ptolemaïs, and
threatened to ravage the gardens and fields which supplied
the city with provisions, if the inhabitants did not pay him
a tribute of fifty thousand golden byzants. The Christians
were not in a condition to resist their enemies, if the latter
had then had any intention of attacking them in earnest;
but the Syrians, exhausted by fatigue, were in want of provisions,
and returned to Damascus, whilst the Mamelukes,
at the same time, retook the route to Cairo; both of them
departing with an intention of returning on the first favourable
occasion to invade and desolate Palestine.</p>

<p>The threats of the Mussulmans redoubled the zeal and
the efforts of Louis to place the Christian cities in a state
of defence; he determined to restore the fortifications of
Sidon, which had been demolished by the Saracens of Damascus,
at the time that the Crusaders landed in Egypt.
He sent a great number of workmen into this city, and the
works were rapidly advancing, when they were all at once
interrupted by the most deplorable occurrence. The place
having a weak garrison, was surprised, and every Christian
it contained put to the sword by the Turcomans, a wandering,
ferocious race, accustomed to live by murder and plunder.
Louis was at Tyre when he learned this disastrous news,
and was about to go to Sidon. Some of the few Syrian inhabitants
that had escaped the carnage, described to him
the unheard-of cruelties of the barbarians; the fury of the
Turcomans had spared neither age nor sex, and in their retreat
they had slaughtered two thousand prisoners. Louis,
deeply afflicted by what he heard, formed at once the determination
to go and attack the Turcomans in Belinas, to
which place they had retired. At the first signal all the
warriors that accompanied him eagerly assumed their armour.
The king wished to place himself at their head, but the
barons strongly opposed his intention, saying, “that he must
not expose a life of so much consequence to the Holy Land,
in such an expedition.” The Christian warriors set forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
on their march. Belinas, or Cæsarea Philippi, was built
upon a declivity of Mount Libanus, near the sources of the
Jordan: the place was only to be approached by narrow
roads and steep ascents; but nothing could stop the Crusaders,
impatient to avenge their murdered brethren. Upon
their arrival at Belinas, the enemy fled in all directions; the
city was taken, and this victory would have been complete, if
the Christian warriors had observed the laws of discipline,
and followed the orders of their leaders. Whilst the French
were taking possession of Belinas, the Teutonic knights
went to attack a Mussulman castle, built upon the neighbouring
heights, whose towers appeared mingled with the
peaks of Libanus. The Saracens, who had rallied at this
place, and began to recover their courage, repulsed the assailants,
and pursued them across the rocks and precipices.
The precipitate retreat of the Teutonic knights threw the
other Christian warriors into confusion; these latter being
huddled together upon a mountainous piece of ground,
where they could neither fight on horseback nor form a
line of battle. The sieur de Joinville, who led the king’s
guards, was more than once upon the point of losing his life,
or of falling into the hands of the Turcomans. At length
the French, by hard fighting, repaired the error of the Germans;
Olivier de Thermes, and the warriors he commanded,
succeeded in repulsing the Mussulmans. The Crusaders,
after having pillaged Belinas, abandoned it, and returned to
Sidon.</p>

<p>Louis IX. arrived there before them: on his approach to
the city, what was his sorrow at seeing on his route the
ground covered with plundered and bloody carcases! These
were the miserable remains of the Christians that had been
slain by the Turcomans.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> They were putrefying fast, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
there had been no one to undertake the charge of burying
them. Louis stopped at beholding the melancholy spectacle,
and turning to the legate, requested him to consecrate a
cemetery, and then gave orders for the burial of the dead
that covered the roads; but instead of obeying him, every
one turned away his eyes and recoiled with disgust. Louis
then sprang from his horse, and taking in his hands one of
the bodies from which exhaled an infectious odour, exclaimed,
“<i>Come, my friends, come, let us bestow a little earth upon the
martyrs of Jesus Christ</i>.” The example of the king reanimated
the courage and the charity of the persons of his suite; all
were eager to imitate him, and the Christians, whom the
barbarians had slaughtered, thus received the honours of
sepulture. This act of pious devotedness of Louis IX. to
the memory of his companions in arms, has been celebrated
by all historians; it presents a strange contrast to the insensibility
of a hero of modern times, who, in a circumstance
almost similar, and in the same country, caused all the
wounded who were left upon a field of battle to be poisoned.</p>

<p>The king remained several months at Sidon, employed in
fortifying the city. In the mean time Queen Blanche was
constantly writing to him and entreating him to return to
France, as she greatly feared she should never see her son
again.</p>

<p>Her presentiments were but too quickly realized. Louis
was still at Sidon, when a message arrived in Palestine,
announcing that the queen regent was no more. It was
the legate of the pope who first received this melancholy
news. He went to seek the king, accompanied by the archbishop
of Tyre and Geoffrey de Beaulieu, Louis’s confessor.
As the prelate announced that he had something important
to communicate, and at the same time exhibited marks of
great grief upon his countenance, the monarch led him
into his chapel, which, according to an old author, “<i>was
his arsenal against all the crosses of the world</i>.” The prelate
began by reminding the king that all that man loves
upon the earth was perishable; “be thankful to God,” added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
he, “for having given you a mother who has watched
over your family and your kingdom with such anxious
care, and so much ability.” The legate paused for a moment,
and then, breathing a profound sigh, continued,
“This tender mother, this virtuous princess, is now in
heaven.” At these words, Louis uttered a piercing cry,
and then burst into a torrent of tears. As soon as he had a
little recovered himself, he fell on his knees before the altar,
and joining and raising his hands, exclaimed, “I thank you
O my God! for having given me so good a mother; it was
a gift of your mercy; you take her back to-day as your
own; you know that I loved her above all creatures; but
since, before all things, your decrees must be accomplished,
O Lord! be your name blessed for ever, and for ever!”
Louis sent away the two prelates, and, remaining alone with
his confessor, he recited the service for the dead. Two days
passed away before he would see anybody. He then desired
Joinville to be called, and upon seeing him, said, “Ah! seneschal,
I have lost my mother.” “Sire,” replied Joinville,
“I am not surprised at that; you knew that she must die at
some time; but I marvel at the great and extravagant grief
that you feel for it, you who have always been so wise a
prince.” When Joinville left the king, <i>Madame Marie de
bonnes Vertus</i> came to beg that he would come to the queen
and endeavour to console her. The good seneschal found
Marguerite bathed in tears, and could not refrain from expressing
his surprise by saying to her, “It is a difficult matter
to believe you are a woman by your weeping, for the grief
you show is for the loss of a woman that you hated more
than any other in the world.” Marguerite replied that it
was not, in fact, for the death of Blanche she was weeping,
“but for the great uneasiness in which I see the king, and
also for our daughter, left under the guardianship of men.”</p>

<p>Louis IX. was present every day at a funeral service celebrated
in memory of his mother. He sent into the West a
great number of jewels and precious stones to be distributed
among the principal churches of France; at the same time
exhorting the clergy to put up prayers for him and for the
repose of the queen Blanche. In proportion with his endeavours
to procure prayers for his mother, his grief yielded
to the hope of seeing her again in heaven; and his mind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
when calmed by resignation, found its most effectual consolations
in that mysterious tie which still unites us with those
we have lost, in that religious sentiment which mixes itself
with our affections to purify them, and with our regrets to
mitigate them.</p>

<p>The death of Queen Blanche seemed to impose an obligation
upon Louis IX. to return to his dominions; and the
news he received from the West convinced him that his presence
was becoming more necessary every day. A war for
the succession of Flanders had broken out again; the truce
with England had just expired; the people were murmuring:
on the other hand, Louis had now nothing he could undertake
in Palestine. He therefore gave his serious attention
to the subject of his return; but as if, on this occasion, he
mistrusted his own understanding, he determined, before he
formed a definitive resolution, to consult the will of God.
Processions were made, and prayers were put up in all the
Christian cities of Palestine, that Heaven might deign to
enlighten those who had been charged with the directing of
a war undertaken in its name. The clergy and barons of
the kingdom of Jerusalem, persuaded that the presence of
Louis was no longer necessary, and that his return to the
West might rouse the enthusiasm of the French warriors
for a new crusade, advised him to embark for Europe; at the
same time expressing their fervent gratitude for all the services
he had rendered to the cause of Jesus Christ during
five years. On preparing for his departure, Louis left a
hundred knights in the Holy Land, under the command of
Geoffrey de Sergines, who fought against the Saracens for
thirty years, and became, in his old age, viceroy of Jerusalem.
Louis quitted Sidon, and, with the queen and three children
that he had had in the East, repaired to Ptolemaïs, in the
spring of 1254. A fleet of fourteen vessels was ready to
receive him and all that remained of the warriors of the
crusade. The day being arrived (April 24th), the king,
walking on foot, followed by the legate, the patriarch of
Jerusalem, and all the nobles and knights of Palestine, took
the road to the port, amidst an immense crowd collected on
his passage. All classes, as they saw him depart, recollected
the virtues of which he had given so bright an example,
particularly his kindness to the inhabitants of Palestine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
whom he had treated as his own subjects. Some expressed
their gratitude by warm acclamations, others by a melancholy
silence; but all proclaimed him <i>the father of the Christians</i>,
and implored Heaven to shower its blessings upon the virtuous
monarch, and upon the kingdom of France. The
countenance of Louis plainly indicated that he fully partook
of the regrets of the Christians of the Holy Land; he
addressed a few consoling words to them, gave them useful
counsels, reproached himself with not having done enough
for their cause, and expressed an earnest desire that God
would some day judge him worthy of finishing the work of
their deliverance.</p>

<p>At length the fleet set sail. Louis had obtained permission
from the legate to take with him, in his vessel, the
Holy Sacrament, for the assistance of the dying and the
sick; so, when beholding altars raised on board a ship,
priests clothed in their sacerdotal habits, celebrating divine
service, and invoking the protection of Heaven at every
hour in the day, it was easy to recognise the pious wreck of
a crusade, and the last trophies of the war of Jesus Christ.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>
As the fleet approached the isle of Cyprus, the vessel in
which the king was struck violently against a sand-bank;
all the crew were seized with terror; the queen and her
children uttered piercing cries; but Louis prostrated
himself at the foot of the altar, and addressed himself
to Him who commands the sea. When the vessel was
examined, it was found that it had received considerable
damage, and the pilots pressed the king to leave it; but
seeing that they themselves did not purpose to abandon the
ship, he determined to remain in it. “There is no one
here,” said he, “who does not love his body as dearly
as I do mine; if I leave, they will leave also, and, perhaps,
will not see their country for a length of time; I prefer
placing myself, my queen, and my children in the hands of
God, to doing such an injury to so great a number of people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
as there are here.” These words, inspired by an heroic
charity, revived the courage of the sailors and the pilgrims,
and they resumed their course. When leaving the coasts of
Sicily, the fleet very carefully kept clear of the coast of
Tunis, as if a secret presentiment warned the French Crusaders
of the misfortunes that awaited them upon that shore
in a still more disastrous expedition. A tempest placed the
fleet in great peril; it was upon this occasion Queen Marguerite
made a vow to offer a ship of silver to St. Nicholas
of Lorraine, and requested Joinville to become her security
with the patron saint of such as are shipwrecked. Whilst
everybody else was in despair, Louis found calmness in a
philosophy derived from religion; and when the danger was
past, he said to his companions: “See if God has not proved
to us how vast is his power, when by means of a single one
of the four winds, the king of France, the queen, their
children, and so many other persons have escaped drowning.”
The navigation lasted more than two months, during which
many marvellous adventures and accidents were encountered
by the pilgrims, which history has preserved an account of, and
which would not figure unworthily in a Christian Odyssey.</p>

<p>The fleet at length cast anchor at the isles of Hières.
Louis crossed Provence, and passing by Auvergne, arrived
at Vincennes on the 5th of September, 1254. The people
flocked from all parts to greet him on his passage; the more
they appeared to forget his reverses, the more strongly was
Louis affected by the remembrance of his lost companions;
and the melancholy that clouded his countenance formed a
painful contrast with the public joy. His first care was to
go to St. Denis, to prostrate himself at the feet of the
apostle of France; on the following day he made his public
entrance into his capital, preceded by the clergy, the nobility,
and the people. He continued to wear the cross upon his
shoulder, the sight of which, whilst recalling the cause of his
long absence, gave his subjects reason to fear that he had
not yet abandoned his enterprise of the crusade. The
greater number of the barons and knights that had gone
with Louis, had found a grave in either Syria or Egypt.
Such as had survived so many disasters, reëntered their
castles, which they found deserted and falling to ruins. The
good seneschal, after having revisited his home, repaired,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
barefooted, to the church of St. Nicholas of Lorraine, to discharge
the vow of Queen Marguerite. He then set earnestly
about repairing the evils his absence had caused, and swore
never again to quit the castle of Joinville to seek adventures
in Asia.</p>

<p>Thus terminated this holy war, the commencement of
which had filled the Christian nations with so much delight,
and which had, in the end, plunged the whole West into
mourning. Throughout the events I have just described,
the seneschal de Joinville has been my guide, and I cannot
terminate my recital without paying him the just tribute of
my gratitude. The unpretending tone of his narration, the
simplicity of his style, the gaiety of his character, have
afforded me a happy relief amidst a labour always dry and
sometimes revolting. I take delight in beholding him intrepid
in the field of battle, preserving his cheerfulness
amidst the misfortunes of war, resigned in his captivity, and
in all his actions recalling to our minds the true spirit of
chivalry. Like his compatriot Villehardouin, he often makes
his heroes weep, and as often weeps himself. He braves
danger, when danger is present; but he thanks God with all
his heart when he has no longer anything to fear.</p>

<p>When I read his memoirs, I am transported back to the
thirteenth century, and I think I am listening to a knight
who is returned from the crusade, and who tells to me all he
has seen and all he has done. He has neither method nor
rule; he drops the line of his discourse, and takes it up
again; and he extends or abridges his narration, as his
imagination is more or less struck by that which he relates.
When we read the narratives of Joinville, we are not surprised
that Louis should have taken so much delight in his
conversation; there is not one of his readers who does not
feel the same confidence and friendship for him that the virtuous
monarch accorded him, and history adopts without
hesitation all that he affirms <i>upon his honour</i>, persuaded
that he who was bold enough to speak the truth in the courts
of kings will not deceive posterity.</p>

<p>The crusade of St. Louis was like that which immediately
preceded it. The enthusiasm for these distant expeditions
was daily losing its vivacity and its energy: the crusade no
longer appeared anything to the knights beyond a common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
war, in which the spirit of chivalry was a more powerful
principle than religion. It was only a religious affair to
Louis IX.</p>

<p>The manner in which this crusade was preached in Europe,
the troubles amidst which the voices of the preachers were
raised, and particularly the means that were employed to
levy the tributes in the West, were calculated to turn away
all minds from the object that would be supposed to be the
governing one in a holy expedition.</p>

<p>And yet Louis took precautions that had been neglected
in preceding wars. Three years were employed in preparing
this great enterprise; the knights who arrived in the isle of
Cyprus could not express their astonishment at seeing the
casks of wine piled one upon another, so high that <i>they appeared
like houses</i>; and heaps of wheat, barley, and other
grains, so immense, <i>that they might be believed to be mountains</i>.
There is no doubt that the princes and nobles who
accompanied Louis imitated his example: happy had it been
for the Crusaders, if their leaders had shown in war the
same prudence and sagacity they displayed in preparing for
their expedition!</p>

<p>The French warriors upon all occasions evinced their
accustomed bravery; but throughout the crusade there was
never exhibited one instance of the genius of a great captain;
Louis himself, when in danger, afforded no example to
his troops beyond courage and firmness. We have related
the prodigies of French valour, and we have described the
prodigies of pious resignation in reverses; the Crusaders
and their leaders merited, even in their disasters and in the
depth of their misery, the esteem and admiration of their
enemies; and it is here that history presents the most beautiful
spectacle she can offer to man: “<i>Glory, the faithful
companion of misfortune</i>.”</p>

<p>We have had occasion, in the course of our narrative, to
remark that French gaiety never abandoned the cross-knights
in their distant expeditions. This gaiety often
mixed itself with the saddest images, and sometimes even
did not respect severe propriety. We beg to be permitted
to repeat on this head a singular anecdote related by Joinville.
On the eve of the battle of Mansourah, one of the
knights of the seneschal of Champagne, named Landricourt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
died; and whilst the funeral honours were being paid to
him, six of his companions in arms talked so loud that they
interrupted the priest who was chanting mass. Joinville
reproved them warmly, and they then laughed aloud, saying
they were talking about remarrying the wife of Messire
Hugh de Landricourt, <i>who was on the bier there</i>. The good
Joinville was very much scandalized at such discourse, and
ordered them to keep silent. When speaking of this indiscreet
gaiety of his knights, the seneschal takes care to add
that God punished them on the day of battle; for of all the
six, he says, there was not one that was not killed and
buried, and whose wife did not afterwards find it convenient
to marry again.</p>

<p>The manners of the European knights formed a very
striking contrast with those of the Mussulmans, who were
always grave and serious, even amidst the festivities in
which they celebrated the deliverance of their country and
the defeat of the Christians.</p>

<p>We have spoken many times of the want of discipline of
the Crusaders; the Saracens were very little better in this
respect; but in addition to having the advantage of fighting
in their own country, with every foot of which they were
acquainted, fortune gave them, in their greatest dangers,
skilful and experienced leaders, who knew how to take advantage
of all the errors of the Christians, and bring back
to their banners that victory that appeared to have been
driven away by the valour of their enemies.</p>

<p>History describes the whole Egyptian nation as struck
with terror at the first appearance of the Crusaders; but
the Mussulmans, reassured by their leaders, soon felt as
much security and confidence as they had experienced alarm;
and as if there was nothing that men forgot so easily as
danger, a year after the taking of Damietta, they could not
conceive what species of madness had led a king of France
to the banks of the Nile. The continuator of Tabary relates
a circumstance on this subject, which paints at once the
opinion and the character of the Mussulmans. The emir
Hossam-Eddin, in the course of a conference with the captive
monarch, said to him: “How did it come into the mind
of the king, whom I perceive endowed with wisdom and
good qualities,&mdash;how did it ever enter his thoughts to trust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
himself to a fragile wooden bark, to brave the rocks of
the sea, to venture into a country filled with warriors impatient
to fight for the Mussulman faith; how could he possibly
believe that he should take possession of Egypt, or
that he should land upon these coasts, without exposing
both himself and his people to the greatest dangers?” The
king of France smiled, but made no reply; and the emir
thus continued: “Some of the doctors of our law have
decided that he who embarks upon the sea twice consecutively,
by thus exposing his life and his fortune, renders
himself unfit to have his evidence taken in a court of
justice, because such gross imprudence sufficiently proves
the weakness of his reason and the unsoundness of his
judgment.” Louis IX. again smiled, and answered the
emir: “He who said so was not deceived; that is a wise
decision.”<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></p>

<p>We have transcribed the account of the Arabian historian,
without according him more credit than he merits.
Christian authors have not been less severe towards St.
Louis, and can find no excuse for his expedition beyond the
seas. Without seeking to justify this crusade, we will content
ourselves with saying here, that the aim of Louis IX.
was not only to defend the Christian states of Syria and to
fight with the enemies of the faith, but to found a colony
which might unite the East and the West by the happy
interchange of productions and knowledge. We have produced,
in the thirteenth book of this history, a letter from
the sultan of Cairo, by which it may be plainly perceived,
that the king of France had other views than those of a
mere conqueror. The historian Mezerai formally says that
the project of the king of France was to establish a colony
in Egypt, a project of which the execution has been attempted
in modern times. “For this purpose,” says Mezerai,
“he took with him a great number of labourers and
artisans, capable, nevertheless, of bearing arms and fighting
in case of need.” To support our opinion, we might add to
the authority of Mezerai that of Leibnitz, who, in a memoir
addressed to Louis XIV., does not hesitate to affirm that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
the motives which determined Louis IX. to undertake the
conquest of Egypt, were inspired by profound wisdom, and
merited the attention of the most skilful statesmen, and of
the most enlightened political writers.</p>

<p>We must however believe that Louis IX. did not contemplate
in their full extent the advantages that might be
derived from his expedition, or that have been discovered in
our age. All the policy of those distant ages consisted in
religious ideas, which insinuated themselves into human
affairs, and often directed them towards an end that human
intelligence was incapable of perceiving. What we do now
for the interests of commerce or civilization, was then done
for the interests of Christianity; and the results were often
the same. Religion, in those times of barbarism and ignorance,
was like a mysterious reason, like a sublime instinct,
given to man to assist him in his search for all that was
doomed to become good and useful to him. We must not
forget that the Christian religion always directed the conduct
of Louis IX., and that it was to the religious inspirations
of this monarch, that France owed those treaties, at
which frankness and good faith presided; those institutions
that consecrated the principles of justice; and all those
monuments of a wise policy, to which modern philosophers
have not been able to refuse their admiration.</p>

<p>The expedition of Louis IX. produced two results for
Egypt that were not at all expected. Two years after the
deliverance of the king, and whilst he was still in Palestine,
the Mamelukes, fearing a fresh invasion of the Franks, in
order to prevent their enemies from taking Damietta and
fortifying themselves in that city, entirely destroyed it.
Some years after, as their fears were not yet removed, and
the second crusade of Louis IX. spread fresh alarms throughout
the East, the Egyptians caused immense heaps of stones
to be cast into the mouth of the Nile, in order that the
Christian fleets might not be able to sail up the river. Since
that period a new Damietta has been built at a small distance
from the site of the former city; but the entrance to
the Nile is still, in our days, closed against all vessels, a sad
and deplorable testimony of the terror which the arms of
the Franks formerly inspired.</p>

<p>History has a deeper lament to make over the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
consequence of this crusade. It is certain that it contributed
greatly to change the form of the Egyptian government,
and to fill that unhappy country with all the scourges that
military despotism brings in its train. It was a spectacle
worthy of our attention and our pity, to see, after a bloody
revolution, a rich and vast country abandoned all at once to
slaves purchased in the most barbarous regions of Asia.
Despotism, which always suspects everything that approaches
it, dreaded the natural defenders of Egypt, and was willing
to confide its safety to men without country and without
family; to those men who, according to the expression of
Tacitus, when speaking of the guards of Artabanus, have
not the least idea of virtue, are incapable of remorse, are instruments
always ready for crime, and only know the hand
that pays them. Most of the dynasties of Syria had already
perished victims of their imprudent confidence in foreign
soldiers. That of Saladin shared the same fate, and was,
like all the others, overthrown by the barbarians whom it
had intrusted with its defence. The dynasty of the Baharite
Mamelukes, which succeeded that of Ayoub, was not destined
to have a long duration; and a body of slaves, purchased
in Circassia, in their turn got possession of the
power that had armed them. Two centuries after, the
Ottoman empire overcame the second dynasty of the Mamelukes;
but their military government, amidst the crimes of
tyranny and excesses of disorder, for a long time braved the
power of the conqueror, and subsisted to the end of the
eighteenth century, when the presence of a French army
completed its annihilation. Thus, two French expeditions
into Egypt were marked, one by the revolt and elevation of
the Mamelukes, the other by their destruction.</p>

<p>Philosophy and humanity, however, derived some advantages
from the expedition of St. Louis, which history does
not dispute. The French monarch heard in Syria that a
powerful emir was collecting a great number of books, and
forming a library which was to be open to all the learned,
and to all desirous of gaining knowledge. He became
anxious to imitate this noble example, and gave orders for
having all the manuscripts preserved in the monasteries
transcribed. This literary treasure, confided to the care of
Vincent de Beauvais, was placed in an apartment near the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
holy chapel, and became the first model of those bibliographical
establishments, of those precious depositories of
letters and sciences, of which the capital of France is now
so justly proud.</p>

<p>It has often been said, that the hospital of the Quinze-Vingts
was established by Louis IX. as an asylum for three
hundred gentlemen who had returned blind from the holy
war. The ordinance by which Louis founded this hospital
says nothing to confirm the opinion at first spread by several
writers, and which has since become sanctioned as a popular
tradition.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> Joinville speaks of the institution of the Quinze-Vingts;
but he says nothing of the motives that induced
the pious monarch to found this establishment. Besides,
we should add that the origin of the Quinze-Vingts is posterior
by several years to his return from the crusade.
Mezerai relates in his history, that an hospital for the blind
was established at Rouen in the middle of the twelfth century;
and this ancient monument of charity might give Louis
the idea of founding a similar institution in his capital.</p>

<p>Before this crusade, Tartary was only known by the formidable
emigrations of the Moguls. This vast region was in
some sort revealed to the West by the missionaries sent
thither by the king of France. William de Longjumeau,
who set out from the isle of Cyprus, collected a great number
of fabulous traditions in the course of his voyage; but he
likewise brought back some curious notices and some exact
observations. Rubruquis, who started during the king’s
abode in Palestine, and returned after the departure of the
Crusaders, did not succeed in his embassy to the powerful
emperor of the Moguls; but, as a traveller, he observed
with sagacity the country, the manners, and the laws of the
Tartars; and his relation is still a valuable monument, that
more recent voyages have not thrown into oblivion.</p>

<p>The chroniclers of the time, even Joinville himself, who
never turned their attention to anything but the events of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
the war, and gave no heed to the progress of civilization,
have said nothing of the knowledge Louis might have acquired
concerning the legislation of the East. What interest would
not the old chronicles possess in our eyes, if they had reported
the conversations of the royal legislator with the
Oriental Christians versed in the study of the laws and
customs that prevailed in the colonies of the Franks! It
was during the sojourn of the king in Syria, that the chancellor
of the kingdom of Cyprus collected all the laws that
formed <i>the Assizes of Jerusalem</i>. Should we not be warranted,
then, in saying that we owe this precious collection to the
counsels, and still more to the encouragement, of Louis IX.?
It is certain that the pious monarch neglected nothing that
would enable him to acquire a knowledge of the usages and
customs of the countries he visited; and that the Assizes of
Jerusalem served as a model for the monument of legislation
which afterwards constituted the greatest glory of his reign.</p>

<p>One advantage of this crusade, and that, doubtless, the
greatest of all, was, that Louis returned much better than
he was when he went, and that adversity developed and
perfected in him all the qualities to which his subjects looked
for their future prosperity. A Protestant historian, when
speaking of this subject, makes use of these remarkable
words: “The fruit of his voyage and of his affliction was,
that he returned a much better man, having increased in
zeal, modesty, prudence, and diligence; and that he was
more honoured and beloved by his people than he had ever
been before his departure; and by the universal earth was
held in singular admiration for his good life and constancy
amidst dangers, as a miracle among kings.”<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a></p>

<p>Far from seeking to forget his misfortunes, Louis was
constantly referring to them, as a great example that God
had been willing to present to the world. He attributed
them principally to his own faults; and the austerities to
which he condemned himself during the remainder of his
life, were, says Father Daniel, a kind of mourning, which he
always wore for the brave men who had perished in the
crusade. On his return, he reformed the coinage, and by his
order, silver Parisis and Gros Tournois were struck, upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
which chains were figured, in order to preserve the memory
of his captivity. These remembrances rendered him more
dear to his people, and greater in the eyes of all Christians.
Happy are princes upon whom the lessons of misfortune are
not lost! happy also is the age in which men are not judged
according to the favours of fortune, and in which the adversity
of the great ones of the earth has in it something
respectable and sacred!</p>

<p>The misfortunes of the time, as we have already said, had
ruined a great number of the most illustrious families of the
kingdom. We know that many nobles had sold their lands
to provide means for undertaking the crusade; and history
has preserved acts passed in the camp, even of Mansourah,
by which several gentlemen sold their domains to the crown.
Louis was not at all willing that his companions in arms
should be condemned to poverty for having followed him
into the East, and for having shared with him the labours
and perils of the holy war; he therefore ordered a list
to be made of the indigent nobility, and found means to
assist them out of his own revenue; he relieved, with
affecting kindness, the widows and orphans of the brave
knights he had seen fall by his side; and his solicitude extended
even to the poor labourers who had suffered, either
in the war of the Pastors, by his absence, or by the inefficiency
of the laws. “Serfs,” said he, “belong to Jesus
Christ as well as to us, and in a Christian kingdom we
ought never to forget that they are our brethren.” Since
his war with the Mussulmans, he could not endure the
idea of the blood of Christians being shed in battle. His
ordinances forbade war between individuals in all the domains
of the crown; and the authority of his example
contributed to maintain order and peace throughout the
provinces.</p>

<p>Before his departure, Louis had sent commissaries to
repair the iniquities committed in the government of his
kingdom. On his return, he was determined to see everything
himself, and pervaded his provinces; being convinced
that God will not pardon kings who have neglected any
opportunity or means of becoming acquainted with the
truth. What a touching spectacle it must have been to
see a king as anxious to discover all the ills that had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
been effected in his name, as other men are to trace out
any injustice done to themselves! In short, his paternal
vigilance succeeded in destroying all abuses, and repairing
all faults; “and finally,” says the noble confidant of his
thoughts, “in lapse of time, the kingdom of France multiplied
so greatly by the justice and rectitude that reigned
in it that the domains, feudal fines, rents, and revenues,
increased in one year by a half, and vastly improved the
kingdom of France.”</p>

<p>We cannot finish the account of this crusade without
speaking of the emperor Frederick II. and Innocent IV.,
who had so much influence over the events we have described.
It may be said of Frederick, that his glory underwent
as many vicissitudes as his fortune. Contemporary
chronicles sometimes praise him with exaggeration, and at
others blame him without measure. Such is ever the fate
of princes who have lived amidst the conflict of parties.
The spirit of party, which has judged them in their lifetime,
leaves to history nothing but uncertainties, and appears
still to exist for them in posterity. No historian has
denied the talent or the genius of Frederick; he was one
of the most illustrious captains of his times; he is placed
among the princes who, by their example and their munificence,
encouraged the revival of letters in the middle ages.
He displayed great qualities upon the throne, but he
did not know how to put himself in harmony with the
spirit of his contemporaries;<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> he had neither the defects
nor the virtues of his age, and that is the reason that he
succumbed in the obstinate struggle with the popes. If
this struggle had not troubled and divided Europe, and if
Frederick had been animated by the same sentiments as
St. Louis, there is no doubt that Christianity would have
triumphed over Islamism, and that the Crusaders would
have subdued a great portion of the East.</p>

<p>The memory of Innocent IV. has been judged as variously
as that of his redoubtable adversary. When looking at his
manifestoes, his warlike enterprises, his spiritual and temporal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
triumphs, we might believe that the most able and
ambitious of conquerors was seated in the chair of St.
Peter. The events to which he has attached his name,
and which he directed by his policy, leave us nothing to
say regarding his genius or his character. After the death
of Frederick, this pontiff returned to Italy, which country
he traversed in triumph; but by a singular contrast, he who
had shaken the power of emperors, only entered Rome tremblingly.
The Romans had sent envoys to him to express
their surprise at seeing him lead a wandering life far from
his capital, and from the flock of which he would have to
render an account to the sovereign judge.</p>

<p>Although obedient in this respect to the will of the people
of Rome, Innocent pursued his projects against the remains
of the imperial family, and death surprised him in the kingdom
of Naples, of which he was taking possession in the
name of the Church; having lost all care for the fate of the
Christian colonies of the East. The pontiff who succeeded
him, although he had neither his ambition, nor his authority,
nor his genius, followed not the less the career that had been
marked out for him. He endeavoured to accomplish all
the threats of the Holy See, and the thunders of Rome reposed
no more in the hands of Alexander VI. than they had
done in those of his predecessors.</p>

<p>That which might justify the persevering, obstinate ardour
with which the popes pursued the posterity of Frederick, is
that by it they liberated Italy from the yoke of the emperors
of Germany; and that this rich country remained sixty
years without seeing the armies of the Germanic empire.
But, on the other side, this advantage was purchased by so
much violence, and by so many calamities, that the nations
were never able to enjoy or know the value of it. The popes,
who were not always sufficiently strong to maintain the work
of their policy, were sometimes obliged to call in foreign
princes to their aid, who introduced fresh subjects of discord
into Italy. War constantly brought on war; conquerors
were expelled by other conquerors. This revolution lasted
during several centuries, and became fatal, not only to Italy,
but to Germany, France, and Spain, to all who wished to
partake of the spoils of the house of Swabia.</p>

<p>It is not our task to describe these afflicting scenes: to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
return to that which more particularly belongs to our subject,
we will glance, whilst terminating these general considerations,
at the crusade which was then being preached
in all the Italian cities against Eccelino de Romano, whom
the voice of the people, as well as the voice of the Church,
had declared to be the enemy of God and men.</p>

<p>This Italian noble had taken advantage of the disorder of
the civil wars, to usurp a tyrannical domination over several
cities of Lombardy and Trevisano. All that we are told of
the tyrants of fabulous antiquity falls short of the cruelties
of Eccelino. Contemporary history compares his barbarous
reign to pestilence, inundations, conflagrations, and the most
terrible convulsions of nature. The pope at first excommunicated
Eccelino, <i>in whom he could see nothing but a wild
beast in a human form</i>; a short time afterwards he published
a crusade against this scourge of God and humanity. John
of Vicenza, who had preached public peace twenty years
before, was the first preacher of this holy war. The faithful
who took up arms against Eccelino, were to receive the same
indulgences as those who went to Palestine. This crusade,
which was undertaken in the cause of humanity and liberty,
was preached in all the republics of Italy: the eloquence of
the holy orators easily prevailed over the multitude; but
that which most inflamed the zeal and ardour of the people,
was the sight of the wretches whom Eccelino had caused to
be mutilated amidst tortures, and the groans and lamentations
of the families from which the tyrant had chosen his
victims. In most of the provinces of Italy, the inhabitants
of the cities and country took up arms to defend the cause
of religion and their native land; eager to obtain the civic
crown, if they triumphed over tyranny, and the crown of
martyrdom, if they chanced to fall.</p>

<p>The standard of the cross was displayed at the head of the
army; the crowd of Crusaders marched against Eccelino,
singing this hymn of the Church,&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppq8 p1">“Vexilla regis prodeunt,<br />
Fulget crucis mysterium.”</p>

<p class="p1">The army of the faithful at first obtained rapid successes;
but as the archbishop of Ravenna, who commanded it,
wanted skill, and as the Crusaders of each town had no
leaders but monks and ecclesiastics, they did not profit by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
their early advantages. The intrigues of policy and the
spirit of rivalry relaxed the ardour of the combatants; victory
was sometimes balanced by reverses: four years of
labours and perils scarcely sufficed for the suppression of an
impious domination, or to avenge humanity by the defeat
and death of Eccelino.</p>

<p>I regret that the plan of this work does not permit me to
speak in greater detail of this war, in which religion so happily
assisted the cause of liberty, and which forms so great a
contrast with most contemporary events. At this period
such a number of crusades were preached, that history can
scarcely follow them, and we feel astonished that the population
of the West was not exhausted by so many unfortunate
wars. Whilst Louis IX. was returning from the
East, where he had left his army, and a holy league was
being formed in Italy against the tyrant Eccelino, sixty
thousand Crusaders, commanded by a king of Bohemia,
marched against the people of Lithuania, still addicted to
the worship of idols; and another army of Crusaders was
leaving the banks of the Oder and the Vistula to combat
the pagans of Prussia, so many times attacked and conquered
by the Teutonic knights. History is gratified at being
able to remark that in this last expedition the cities of
Brunsbad and Konigsberg were founded; but the founding
of two flourishing cities cannot obliterate the remembrance
of the desolation of many provinces. If any advantages
could arise from these sanguinary expeditions, they were
certainly the progressive steps of Christianity, which brought
together people till that time separated by difference in manners
and religious belief; they were the lessons of misfortune
and the fruits of experience, which in the end enlightened
Europe, and gave to the human mind a new direction
more conformable with the laws of justice and reason, more
favourable to the interests of humanity. It is thus that
Providence, always mixing good with evil, renews human
societies, and sows the prolific seeds of civilization in the
very heart of disorder and barbarism.</p>

Aboulfeda and some other Arabian historians point out sufficiently
succinctly the division that the Ayoubite princes made of the vast provinces
that formed the empire of Saladin. This empire included Syria, Egypt,
almost all Mesopotamia, and even a great portion of Arabia.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Aziz, as we have said, established himself in Egypt; Afdhal and Thaher
shared Syria between them, one reigning at Damascus, and the other at
Aleppo. Adel retained, as his part, the cities situated beyond the
Euphrates, which composed the <i>eastern provinces</i>, that is, Mesopotamia
proper. To these three great divisions were attached several feudatory
princes, who governed as fiefs various cities of the empire. Hamah,
Salamiak, Moanah, and Mambedj belonged to Mansour; it was from this
branch that issued the celebrated Aboulfeda: the family of Chirkoùh was
established at Emessa; Thaher, son of Saladin, enjoyed Bosra; Amdjed,
great-grandson of Ayoub, was prince of Balbek; Chëizer, Abou Cobaïs,
Sahyoun, Tell-Bacher, Kaubeb, Adjloun, Barin, Kafar-Tab, and Famieh
were possessed by various emirs who had served in the armies of Saladin.</p>
<p class="pfc4">As to Yémen, a province of Arabia, in which Touran-chah established
himself, the family of the Ayoubites reigned there till 1239.</p>

At the death of Saladin Jerusalem came into the possession of
Afdhal, his son, who gave it in fief to the emir Azz-eddin Djerdik. Aziz
becoming master of Damascus, the holy city fell into the hands of another
emir, Ilm-eddin Caísser; to him succeeded Aboulhedj, the favourite of
Adel; for in the division that this prince and his nephew Aziz made of
Egypt and Syria, Palestine remained in the power of Adel. Aboul-Hédj
was in his turn replaced by the famous emir Aksankar-el-Kébir, and he
by Meïmoun, 1197. When the empire became reunited under the
dominion of Adel, his son Moaddhem had Damascus, of which Palestine
and Jerusalem were dependencies.</p>

This is the text of the oath, as it has been preserved by an historian:&mdash;“I,
such a one, devote myself entirely from this moment to the
service of the sultan Elmélek Alnaser Salak-eddin, as long as he shall
live. I swear to consecrate my life, my property, my sword, and my
powers to the defence of his empire, and to be always obedient to his
orders. I swear to observe the same engagements after him to his son
and heir Almélek Alafdhal. I swear to submit myself to him, to fight for
his empire and states with my life, my wealth, my sword, and my troops.
I swear to obey him in everything; I devote myself to him inwardly and
outwardly, and I take God for a witness of this engagement.”</p>

This vizier was named Nasr-allah, and bore the surname of Dhiaeddin,
‘the splendour of religion;’ he was brother of the celebrated historian
Ibn-Elatzir, author of the <i>Tarikh Kamel</i>, and himself cultivated
letters with success. The study of most of the sciences occupied his
youth, and his memory was adorned with the most beautiful passages of
the ancient and modern poetry of his nation. Saladin had given him as
vizier to his son, and Nasr-allah proved by his conduct that he was worthy
of the honour. If he committed faults as a minister, he at least honoured
his character by remaining faithful to his master, sharing his misfortunes,
and following him into exile. After remaining some time at Samosata,
whither Afdhal was banished, he came to Aleppo, and entered into the
service of Thaher, who reigned there; and becoming dissatisfied with his
conduct, he quitted the court, and retired to Mossoul, where he took up
his residence. He died at Bagdad in 1239, whilst fulfilling a diplomatic
mission with which the prince of Mossoul had charged him. Nasr-allah
left several literary works, the nomenclature of which is contained in the
biography of Ibn-Khilcan.</p>

M. Am. Jourdain has published a curious account of Aboulfeda and

The Hospitallers then possessed within the limits of Christendom
<i>nineteen thousand manors</i>; the Templars had only <i>nine thousand</i>. Matthew
Paris expresses himself thus:&mdash;Habent insuper Templarii in Christianitate
novem millia maneriorum; Hospitalii vero novem decem, præter
emolumenta et varios proventus ex fraternitatibus et prædicationibus
provenientes, et per privilegia sua accrescentes.&mdash;<i>Matth. Paris.,</i> ad annum
1244, in Henry III., lib. xi. p. 615. A manor in the middle ages <i>was
the labour of one plough</i>.</p>

We possess two letters written by Celestine to Hubert, archbishop of
Canterbury, to engage him to preach the crusade. The pope commands
the archbishop to employ ecclesiastical censures against those who, after
taking the cross, delayed their departure for the Holy Land; and to require
such as could not possibly set out, to send, at their own expense,
one or two men to fight against the infidels.</p>

All the facts relative to the preaching of this crusade are to be found
in Roger de Hoveden, Matthew Paris, Godfrey Moine, William of Newbridge,
Otho of St. Blaise, and Arnold of Lubeck. The latter gives the

took the cross on this occasion.</p>

The long lists of the names and titles of the Crusaders may at first

Roger de Hoveden gives this account of the death of Henry of
Champagne. Arnold of Lubeck says that this prince had placed himself
at a window to take the air. The same Arnold adds that many thought
that God had punished Henry for the regret he had evinced on the arrival
of the Germans, whom he envied the glory of delivering the kingdom of
Christ.</p>

Arnold, who gives an account of this message of the dove, appears
to fear that it will not be believed. This is the manner in which he expresses
himself in the third chapter:&mdash;Hic quiddam dicturus sum non
ridiculum, sed ridiculè à gentibus tractum, qui quoniam sapientiores filiis
iucis in generatione suâ sunt, multa excogitant, quæ nostrates non noverunt,
nisi fortè ab eis didicerint. Solent enim ex untes ad quælibet
negotia secum exportare columbas, quæ domi aut ova aut pullos noviter

sub umbilico columbæ subtiliter ponunt, et eam avolare permittunt.

The picture of Falcandus is perfectly prophetic, and describes events
exactly like those which came after him. We will quote the most curious
passages:&mdash;Intueri mihi jam videor turbulentas barbarorum acies, eo qua
feruntur impetu irruentes, civitates opulentas et loca diuturnâ pace florentia
metu concutere, cæde vastare, rapinis atterere, et fœdare luxuriâ. Ingerit
se mihi, et lachrymas a nolente futuræ species calamitatis extorquet.
Occurrunt hinc cives aut resistendo gladiis intercepti, aut se dedendo
miserâ servitute depressi.  Illine virgines in ipsis parentum conspectibus
constupratæ; matronæ post varia et preciosa capitis, colli, et pectoris
ornamenta direpta, ludibrio habitæ defixis in terrâ oculis inconsolabiliter
deplorantes, venerabile fœdus conjugii fœdissimæ gentis libidine
violari.  Nec enim aut rationis ordine regi, aut miseratione deflecti, aut
religione terreri Theutonica novit insania, quam et innatus furor exagitat,
et rapacitas stimulat, et libido præcipitat. Hæc autem in Apuliâ vicinisque
provinciis geri, licet horrendum ac triste sit facinus, et multo cum
mœrore deflendum, utcunque tamen tolerabile putaretur, si in cispharinis
tantum partibus barbarorum immanitas desæviret. Servire barbaris
jam cogetur antiqua illa Corinthiorum nobilitas qui patriis olim relictis
sedibus, in Siciliam transuentes, et urbi construendæ locum idoneum
perquirentes, tandem in optimâ et pulcherrimâ parte Siciliæ inter inæquales
portus mœnia sua loco tutissimo construxerunt.  Quid tibi nunc
prodest philosophorum quondam floruisse doctrinis, et poëtarum ora
vatifici fontis nectare proluisse? satiùs tibi quidem esset ac tutiùs, Siculorum
adhuc tyrannorum sævitiam pati, quam barbaræ fœdæque gentis
tyrannidem experiri.  Væ tibi fons celebris et præclari nominis Arethusa,
quæ ad hanc devoluta est miseriam, ut quæ poëtarum solebas carmina

Roger de Hoveden says that the Mussulman prince of Jerusalem
had offered to deliver the city up to the Franks, and even to become a
Christian. If the Mussulman prince had really made such a proposition,
we cannot easily guess why the Christians should not have accepted it.
But Roger is the only historian that mentions this perfectly incredible
circumstance: Oriental historians are silent.</p>

fortified Jerusalem:&mdash;Pagani summâ industriâ civitates et castella quæ

opposito, et fossatis profundissimus cingentes, inexpugnabilem

Oriental historians say little of the siege of Thoron; the continuator
of Tabary expresses himself thus:&mdash;“The Franks attacked Tebnyn
(Thoron), and made breaches on various sides. When Malek-Adel learnt
this, he wrote to Melic-Alaziz, sultan of Egypt, to desire him to come in
person; ‘for if you do not come,’ said he, ‘we shall not be able to protect
the frontier country.’ Alaziz then came with his troops. As to the Mussulmans
who were in the castle, when they saw the breaches made in their
walls, and they had no hope but defending themselves at the point of the
sword, many among them surrendered to the Franks, and demanded a
safeguard for themselves and their property, offering to deliver up the
castle. The command was given to the priest Kandelard (Conrad), a
German; but a Frank of the Sahel (coast of Syria) said to the Mussulmans,
‘If you give up the fortress, these men will make you prisoners,
and will kill you: preserve your own days then.’ The Mussulmans left
them as if to give up the fortress; but when they had re-ascended, they
persisted in defending themselves, and fought in despair, so that they kept
the castle till the arrival of Melic-Alaziz at Ascalon.”</p>

Otho de St. Blaise appears convinced that the Templars had received
money to betray the cause of the Christians. He expresses himself as
follows:&mdash;Nam sicut fertur, quidam de militibus Templi, à paganis corrupti
pecuniâ, animam Conradi cancellarii, qui in hâc ipsâ obsidione præcipuè
clarebat, cum quibusdam aliis inflexerunt, eisque auri maximo
pondere collocato, obsidionem solvere persuaserunt; sicque vendito
Christo tradito paganis per castellum, sicut olim Judæis, recesserunt.
Nec tamen de pretio taliter acquisito aliquod emolumentum, sicut nec
Judas de triginta argenteis, consecuti sunt. Si quidem pretio corrupti,
corruptum à paganis aurum metallo sophistico, auro in superficie colorato
receperunt; sicque in opprobrium sempiternum cum notâ infamiæ meritò
consecuti sunt.&mdash;See <i>Oth. de St. Blaise</i>, in the collection of Urtius.</p>

We are astonished to find so little concerning this crusade in the
continuator of William of Tyre. He speaks of this battle and of the
division among the Christians, but without any circumstance worthy of
being communicated to our readers.</p>

Arnold of Lubec says that the news of the death of the emperor of
Germany arrived before the siege of Thoron; but it is not probable that
the Crusaders, who were suddenly so anxious to return to the West on
account of the troubles that threatened Germany, should have undertaken
the siege of Thoron after hearing of a death which must give rise
to great events in Europe. Henry died in the month of September,
1196; the siege of Thoron was begun nearly at the same time; thus the
Crusaders could not be informed at that period of a circumstance which
made them so suddenly renounce the holy war.</p>

Le Père Maimbourg bestows the greatest praise upon the widow of

body by greatness of soul and strength of mind.”</p>

Fuller, an English historian, speaks of this disaster at great length.
As his work is scarce, I will translate the passage from it relative to this
crusade, in which the impartial reader will find the gross misrepresentations
of a violent enemy of the Crusaders. “In this war,” says he, “we
may contemplate an episcopal army which might have served for a synod;
or, more truly, it offers us a picture of the <i>Church militant</i>. Many
captains returned home secretly, and when the soldiers wanted to fight,
the officers went away: what remained of this army fortified themselves
in Jaffa. The feast of St. Martin, that great saint of Germany, fell at
this time. This holy man, a German by birth, and bishop of Tours in
France, distinguished himself eminently by his charity. The Germans
changed his charity for the poor into excess for themselves, observing the
11th of November in such a manner that it ought no longer to be called
a saint’s day, but a day of festivity. Drunkenness reduced them to such
a state, that the Turks, falling upon them, killed more than twenty thousand
of them. This day, which the Germans write in red letters in their
calendars, takes its colour from their own blood, and as their camp was a
slaughter-house, the Turks were their butchers. We may compare them
to the oxen of St. Martin, which differ little from droves of drunkards.”&mdash;<i>Nicol.
Fuller</i>, b. ii. chap. xvi. p. 133. [I really cannot see that old
Fuller is so very widely wrong.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Trans.</span>]</p>

The Latin and Greek chronicles both describe the cruelties of
Henry VI. in Sicily. Nicetas, in his history, makes a long enumeration
of the punishments invented by the emperor of Germany, and says that
Greece was on the eve of seeing all the evils that afflicted Sicily fall upon
her territory, when Henry VI. was removed, as if by an extraordinary
interposition of Providence.</p>

Our excellent author has conceived a kind of parental affection for
the crusades, which makes him blind to their defects. If we speak of the
<i>spirit</i> of Christianity, certainly the philosopher of Geneva has the advantage
of him, as his own pages show. Divested of their mundane motives,
the crusades were little else than “a savage fanaticism.” There was, at
least, as much religious merit in the Mussulmans, who fought to defend
their faith. A philosopher may deduce beneficial results from the crusades,
particularly to Europe; but he will be much puzzled to prove that
that which we now consider a truly Christian spirit, influenced many of
the warriors that carried them out, or the churchmen that promoted them.
The Inquisition and the crusade against the Albigeois were of the same

Several historians say that Dandolo was blind, and that the emperor
Manuel Comnenus had deprived him of sight during an abode he made at
Constantinople. One of his descendants, André Dandolo, says merely
in his history that his ancestor was short-sighted (<i>visu debilis</i>). The part
of the story connected with Manuel Comnenus appears to be a fable.
Historians differ as to the age of Dandolo: Ducange, at the period of the
crusade, gives him ninety-four years. Gibbon does not doubt of his
blindness, though he has no faith in its having been caused by Manuel;
but he certainly assigns to him actions that could scarcely be performed
by a blind man. He does not believe the accounts of his very advanced
age, saying,&mdash;“It is scarcely possible that the powers of mind and body
should support themselves at such an age.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Trans.</span></p>

Several authors have thought that Villehardouin could not write; and
they found their opinion upon what he himself says,&mdash;“<i>I, who dictated
this work</i>.” However that may be, the history of Villehardouin has been
pronounced by learned men to be a model of the language that has
ceased to be French. In the sixteenth century the language of the
marshal of Champagne was already not understood; his history was
turned into modern French by Blaise de Vigenère towards the end of the
sixteenth century; this translation has itself become so old as to be now
scarcely intelligible. The new version that Ducange made of it in the
seventeenth century still bears an impression of antiquity, which preserves
something of the <i>naïveté</i> of the original. We shall often have occasion
to quote Villehardouin; but we shall only quote the ancient versions, and
sometimes from a translation we have ourselves made, always endeavouring
to preserve as far as possible the simplicity of the old language.</p>

At the same time that Egypt experienced all the horrors of famine,
Richard of St. Germain and the Chronicle of Fossa-Nova (see <i>Muratori</i>)
say that a great dearth was felt in Italy and Spain; one of them adds that
this year, 1202, was known under the name of “annus famis.” Mézerai
speaks of this famine, which was felt in France, and attributes it to the war
then carried on between Philip and Richard. “The two kings,” says he,
“pillaged the lands, pulled up their vines, cut down the trees, cut the
harvest whilst unripe, and destroyed more cities and towns in one day
than had been built in ages. Famine followed these horrible ravages,
says an author; so that many of the richest were reduced to beg their
bread, and finding none to give it to them, ate grass and burrowed in the
earth for roots.”</p>

The Abbé Lebeuf, in his <i>History of the Diocese of Paris</i>, vol. vi.
p. 20, gives us a description of the tomb of Foulques of Neuilly, which
was still standing in the last century. “The tomb of Foulques, the
famous curé of this place about the year 1200, is in the nave, before the
entrance to the choir, built of stone a foot and a half high. It is the
work of the age in which this pious personage died. Foulques is represented
in relief upon the monument, clothed as a priest, his head bare,
having the tonsure on the top, and the hair so short that the whole of his
ears is visible. A book is laid upon his breast, which he does not hold,
as his hands are crossed above, the right placed upon the left. His
chasuble and his manipule represent the vestments of his times. He has
under him a kind of footstool, cut in the stone, and two angels in relief
incense his head, which is placed towards the west; for, after the ancient
manner, his feet are pointed to the east, or the altar. It is not true, as
has been said, that this tomb is incensed, nor has it any arms. He is
called in the country Sir Foulques, and sometimes Saint Sire Foulques.
There is a tradition that the canons of St. Maur formerly endeavoured to
carry it away; but the immobility of the car with which this story is
adorned, tells us what degree of faith may be attached to it.” M. l’Abbé
Chastelain names his death, in his <i>Universal Martyrology</i>, as having
taken place on the 2nd of March, 1201, and qualifies him as <i>venerable</i>.</p>

We find in the continuator of William of Tyre the following circumstance:&mdash;Malek-Adel
being informed that the Crusaders were assembling
at Venice, conceived great uneasiness regarding their ulterior designs.
He called together the heads of the Christian clergy at Cairo, and announced
to them that a new expedition was preparing in Europe, and that
they must provide themselves with horses, arms, and provisions. The
bishops, to whom he addressed himself to obtain the succour of which he
stood in need, replied that their sacred ministry did not allow them to
fight. “Well,” answered Malek-Adel, “since you cannot fight yourselves,
you must provide me with men to fight in your place.” He then
demanded of them an account of the lands they possessed, and ordered
that these lands should be sold; and the money produced by this confiscation
was sent to Venice, to corrupt the leaders of that republic, and to
engage them to divert the Crusaders from an expedition into Egypt or
Syria. Malek-Adel at the same time promised the Venetians all sorts of
privileges for their trade in the port of Alexandria. This singular circumstance,
related at first, as we have said, by the continuator of William
of Tyre, is to be found also in Bernard <i>Thesaurarius</i>, and in the <i>Chronicle</i>
of St. Victor. Marin. Sanut, it is true, passes it by in silence, and contents
himself with saying that Malek-Adel went into Egypt and there
collected a treasure. But it may be observed that Marin. Sanut was a
Venetian, and had a good reason not to report all the details of a fact
which was not to the glory of his country. Bernard when relating it, adds:&mdash;Qualiter
autem hujus rei effectus fuerit in opinione patenti multorum

A double alliance and the dignity of Cæsar had connected the two
elder brothers of Boniface with the imperial family. Reinier of Montferrat
had married Mary, daughter of the emperor Manuel Comnenus;
Conrad, who had defended Tyre before the third crusade, was married to
Theodora Angela, sister of the emperors Isaac and Alexius.</p>

The army was no longer to be dreaded by the emperors as it had
been in the early days of the empire; but it was no more an object of fear
to its enemies than to its master. A modern historian, M. Sismondi,
finds in the government of the Greek empire a complete and incontestable
evidence of the natural and necessary effects of the worst of
governments. The ancients were acquainted with scarcely any medium
between liberty and despotism. The government of Constantinople had
retained, up to the middle of the middle ages, all which characterized the
despotism of the ancients, although we must allow that this despotism was
sometimes tempered by religion and the influence of the patriarchs of
Byzantium.</p>

Lebeau, in his <i>History</i>, describes at length the decline of the Greek
empire and the vices of the emperors. Gibbon, a much more enlightened
observer, sometimes neglects important details connected with this period,
and in his latter volumes, too often forgets the Greeks to speak of the
barbarous nations of the East and West that had shared the wrecks of the
Roman empire.</p>

It would be difficult to give a very exact idea of the city of Constantinople
as it was at the period of this crusade. Among the travellers who
have described this capital at a time nearer than our own to the middle
ages, we ought to remark Peter Gilles and Grelot, who saw Constantinople,
the one in the reign of Francis I., and the other in the reign of
Louis XIV. Their description has furnished those who came after them
with many documents. Revolutions, wars, the Turks, and fires change
every day the aspect of this city, which was already much altered in the
times of the travellers we have named. Ducange, in his <i>Christiana Constantinopolis</i>,
and Banduri, in his <i>Imperium Orientale</i>, have collected all
the information of the old travellers and the Greek historians. Among
modern travellers <i>Constantinople, Ancient and Modern</i>, by the Englishman
Dallaway, and <i>Le Voyage de la Propontide</i>, by M. Lechavalier, may
be consulted with advantage.</p>

Ducange, in his observations upon Villehardouin, gives a very

The Varangians, who were in the service of the Greek emperors,
have given rise to many discussions among the learned. Villehardouin
says that the Varangians were English and Danes. The count de St.
Pol, in a letter written from Constantinople, calls them English, Livonians,
Dacians. Other historians call them Celts, Germans. The word
Varangians appears to be taken from an English word <i>waring</i>,<sup>(a)</sup> which
means warrior; this word is met with in the Danish, and several other
tongues of the north of Europe. Ducange thinks the Varangians came
from Danish England, a small province of Denmark, between Jutland
and Holstein. M. Malte Brun, in the notes that accompany the <i>History
of Russia</i>, by Lévesque, thinks the Varangians drew their recruits from
Scandinavia; that some came from Sweden by Norvogorod and Kiow,
others from Norway and Denmark by the Atlantic and the Mediterranean.
We still possess a dissertation upon the Varangians by M. de Villoison,
in which we find more learning than criticism. The most probable opinion
is that of Ducange and M. Malte Brun. We have but one observation
to make, which is, that it is probable the Varangians were not members of
the Roman church; if they followed the Greek religion, may we not
believe that they belonged to the nations of the North, among whom it
had been introduced?</p>

The marshal of Champagne describes to us the order of battle of the
Latins, as it was drawn up according to the tactics of the middle ages.
The Crusaders issued from their camp divided into six bodies; they ranged
themselves before their palisades. The knights were on horseback, their
sergeants and esquires were behind them close to the quarters of their
horses; the crossbow-men and archers were in front.</p>

The Greeks and Latins were divided on three principal points; first,
the addition made by the Latin Church to the creed of Constantinople, to
declare that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father; 2nd the refusal
on the part of the Greeks to acknowledge the primacy of the pope; 3rdly
the pretension of the Greeks that it is not possible to consecrate in the
Eucharist with unleavened bread. Photius began the schism; the patriarch
Cerularius established it; this latter wished to be acknowledged as the
head of the universal Church instead of the pope. L’Abbé Fleury, in his
<i>Histoire Ecclesiastique</i>, thinks that the schism of the Greeks only really
began at the period the Latins were masters of Constantinople.</p>

Villehardouin, after having described the court of Alexius, in this
ceremony naïvely adds: Tout cela se sentait bien sa cour d’un si puissant
et riche prince. The title of <i>puissant</i> scarcely suited a prince who was
hearing war declared against him in his own palace; and the epithet <i>rich</i>
was hardly more applicable to him, since he could not pay what he had
promised, and thereby redeem his empire from the greatest danger.</p>

Mourzoufle deprived Nicetas of the place of Logothete, to give it to
his brother-in-law Philocales. Nicetas treats Mourzoufle with much
severity, and among the reproaches he addresses to him, we may remark
one which suffices to paint the court of Byzantium. The greatest crime
of the usurper was not that of having obtained sovereignty by parricide,
but postponing the distribution of his favours.</p>

victory over Maximus; it was surmounted by a statue of Victory in bronze,
and ornamented profusely with gold. On the remains of this gate may

Nicetas speaks of the carnage which followed the taking of Constantinople.
We have quoted the words even of Villehardouin, who does not
materially contradict Nicetas. The pope in his letters warmly reproached
the Crusaders on this subject. Gunther only carries the number of slain,
on the entrance of the Crusaders into Jerusalem, to two thousand persons,
and attributes this slaughter to the Latins established at Constantinople,
who had great cause of complaint against the Greeks. The same historian
informs us that the ecclesiastics that followed the army contributed, by
their discourses, to put an end to the massacre. He does not omit this
occasion to praise the piety and humanity of Martin Litz, who went
through the ranks of the victorious army, preaching moderation to the
conquerors.</p>

There was nothing so difficult, says Nicetas, as to soften the fierce

folly to speak reason to them.</p>

The eleventh and twelfth volumes of the <i>Memoirs of the Royal Society
of Gottingen</i> contain a beautiful work of the illustrious Heyne, upon the
monuments of art that have existed at Constantinople. In the first
memoir he gives the nomenclature of the ancient monuments,&mdash;<i>Priscæ
Artis Opera</i>. In the second those that were erected under the emperors
of Byzantium. In two other memoirs, the same learned author describes
the loss of these same monuments: <i>De Interitu Operum cum antiquæ tam
verioris ætatis</i>.</p>

The Bellerophon. This statue is that of Theodosius, showing a
trophy placed upon a neighbouring column; it was thus the Pacificator
was represented: <i>fuit a Deo pacificatoris habitus</i>. Nicetas says that in
his left hand he held a globe. The statues of the other emperors of Constantinople
present a similar sign, to which a cross is attached. The
people believed that under the hoof of the left fore foot, was the figure of
a Venetian or a Bulgarian, or of a man of some other country which had
no intercourse with the Romans. The statue being destroyed by the
Latins, it was said that the figure of a Bulgarian was found concealed in
the hoof, crossed by a nail and incrusted in lead. This statue came from
Antioch in Syria. At the quadrilateral base was a basso-relievo, in which
the populace, ever superstitious, fancied they beheld the prediction of the
fall of the empire. They even said that the Russians there represented
would accomplish the prediction.</p>

One of the French translators of Gibbon, of a single statue has made
two; he speaks of a statue of Joshua and of another of Bellerophon. It
is true that this gross error is only met with in one French translation;
the English original says that in the opinion of the vulgar, this statue
passed for that of Joshua, but that a more classical tradition recognised
in it that of Bellerophon and Pegasus; the free and spirited attitude of the
courser indicating that he trod on air rather than on the earth.</p>

Heyne attributes it to Lysippus; he thinks it is the same as the
colossal Hercules of Tarentum, which was brought to Rome and placed in
the Capitol. From this city it went to Constantinople, with ten other
statues, under the consulate of Julian and the reign of Constantine, that
is to say, about 322; but it was not till after being exhibited in the Basilic
that it was placed in the Hippodrome.</p>

We have spoken in the early part of the work of the true cross which
the kings of Jerusalem caused to be borne before them in battle, and
which was taken by Saladin at the battle of Tiberias; Saladin refused to
deliver it up to Richard, as many of the Crusaders must have known.
How then could the true cross be found at Constantinople? The Greeks,
however, were not very nice with respect to the authenticity of their
relics, and the Christians of the West on this point yielded very easy
faith to them. [I cannot but think our author a little out in his criticism
here: they were but fragments or portions of the cross, at Constantinople
the Saracens still held the main body of the true cross&mdash;<i>if true it was</i>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Trans.</span>]</p>

Villehardouin, when speaking of the rigorous justice exercised upon
all who endeavoured to conceal any part of the plunder, says: Et en y eut

One edition of Villehardouin makes the plunder of Constantinople
amount to five hundred thousand silver marks, equivalent to twenty-four
millions; if we add to this sum the fifty thousand marks due to the Venetians,
and deducted before the division, and the part which they had in the
division itself, we shall find the total amount of booty fifty millions four
hundred thousand francs (about £2,100,000.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Trans.</span>). As much, says
the modern historian who supplies us with this note, perhaps, was appropriated
secretly by individuals. The three fires which had consumed more
than half the city had destroyed at least as much of its riches, and in the
profusion that followed the pillage, the most precious effects had lost so
much of their value, that the advantage of the Latins probably was not
equivalent to a quarter of what they had cost the Greeks. Thus we may
suppose that Constantinople, before the attack, contained 600,000,000 of
wealth (£25,000,000). (What would the plunder of London amount to
in 1852?&mdash;<span class="smcap">Trans.</span>)</p>

Nicetas relates all the circumstances of the sharing of the lands of the
empire. We find in <i>Muratori</i> the treaty for the division which was made
before the siege; we do not offer it to our readers, because it is unintelligible
in several places, and cannot shed any light over geography. The
names of the cities and provinces of the empire are given in a very
unfaithful and imperfect manner. The Venetians without doubt furnished
the necessary information for the drawing up of the treaty, but this information
was very incomplete.</p>

The pope would not at first recognise this election, which appeared
to him a usurpation of the rights of the Holy See; but as Morosini was an
ecclesiastic of great merit, Innocent was not willing to choose another.
Morosini was sent to Constantinople not as if elected by the Crusaders,
but as if appointed by the pope.</p>

Innocent, when speaking of the sack of Constantinople, expresses
himself thus in his letter:&mdash;Quidam nec religioni, nec ætati, nec sexui
pepercerunt; sed fornicationes, adulteria, et incestus in oculis omnium
exercentes, non solum meretriculas et viduas, sed et matronas et virgines
Deoque dicatas exposuerunt spurcitiis garcionum. The pope is more
severe towards the Crusaders than Nicetas himself; the indignation that
the disobedience of the Crusaders had created, led him to exaggerate their
faults. The word <i>incestus</i>, applied to warriors who had no family relations
with the Greeks, alone serves to prove that there is more bitterness than
truth in the letter of Innocent.</p>

It is here that for the last time we quote the <i>History</i> of Villehardouin;
we shall perhaps be reproached with having quoted it too often,
and by that means given too much monotony to our account. We will
answer, that the natural relation and expressions of such an historian, who
relates what he has seen and that which he has experienced, have appeared
to us above all that talent or the art of writing could substitute in their
place. We are pleased at believing, that if our recital has been able
to interest our readers, we owe a great part of this interest to the multiplied
quotations from Villehardouin and other contemporary historians.</p>

Among the romantic accounts that were circulated concerning Baldwin,
we must not omit the following:&mdash;The emperor was kept close
prisoner at Terenova, where the wife of Joannice became desperately in
love with him, and proposed to him to escape with her. Baldwin rejected
this proposal, and the wife of Joannice, irritated by his disdain and
refusal, accused him to her husband of having entertained an adulterous
passion. The barbarous Joannice caused his unfortunate captive to be
massacred at a banquet, and his body was cast on to the rocks, a prey to
vultures and wild beasts.</p>
<p class="pfc4">But people could not be convinced that he was dead. A hermit had
retired to the forest of Glançon, on the Hainault side, and the people of
the neighbourhood became persuaded that this hermit was Count Baldwin.
The solitary at first answered with frankness, and refused the homage
they wished to render him. They persisted, and at length he was induced
to play a part, and gave himself out for Baldwin. At first he had a great
many partisans; but the king of France, Louis VIII., having invited him
to his court, he was confounded by the questions that were put to him:
he took to flight, and was arrested in Burgundy by Erard de Chastenai, a
Burgundian gentleman, whose family still exists. Jane countess of
Flanders caused the impostor to be hung in the great square of Lisle.&mdash;See

We cannot refrain from offering our readers a curious passage from
an excellent manuscript memoir which M. Jourdain has communicated
to us, entitled <i>Recherches sur les Anciennes Versions Latines d’Aristote
employées par les Ecclésiastiques du 13me Siècle</i>. “Two circumstances
contributed in the thirteenth century to materially spread the knowledge
of the Greek language in the West. Baldwin, who was placed upon the
imperial throne, wrote to Pope Innocent III. to beg of him to send to
him men distinguished by their piety and knowledge, chosen from the
religious orders and the University of Paris, to instruct his new people in
the Catholic religion and Latin letters. The pope wrote to several monastic
orders and to the University of Paris. About the same time Philip
Augustus founded at Paris, near the mountain St. Geneviève, a Constantinopolitan
college, destined to receive the young Greeks of the most distinguished
families of Constantinople. The intention of this prince was
to extinguish in the hearts of these young men the hatred they had imbibed
against the Latins, by offering to them all sorts of kind treatment,
and perhaps also to secure hostages against the fickleness and bad faith of
the Greeks.” We can conceive that this circumstance contributed powerfully
in diffusing the knowledge of Greek, not only in France but in all
the West, for Paris was then the most celebrated school, and almost all
the men to whom Latin translations from the Greek are attributed, had
studied in that city: we must also assign to the same cause the Latin
versions of Aristotle made from the Greek and published before St. Thomas.
Nevertheless, if the Arabs had not previously spread throughout the West
a taste for the Peripatetic philosophy, it is very doubtful whether the
relations established between the East and the West by the inauguration
of Baldwin, would have produced any desire to obtain it from purer
sources.</p>

Since their restoration to Venice, the history of these three celebrated
horses has given birth to three dissertations. In one (<i>Narrazione Storica
dei Quatro Cavalli di Bronzo</i>, &amp;c.), Count Cicognara, president of the
Royal Academy of Fine Arts at Venice, pretends that this monument was cast
at Rome in the reign of Nero, in commemoration of the victory over Tiridates.
M. Schlegel (<i>Lettera ai Signori Compilatori della Biblioteca
Italiana</i>) rejects this opinion of the count, and thinks that the four bronze
horses are from the hands of a Greek statuary of the time of Alexander.&mdash;<i>Dei
Quatro Cavalli della Basilica di S. Marco.</i> Andre Mustoxidi, a
very learned young Greek, makes this superb group come from Chios,
which was rich in skilful sculptors, and believes they were transmitted to
Rome in the time of Verres, and to Constantinople under Theodosius the
Great.</p>

History has great trouble in following the events of this period
through the cloud of anarchy which reigned everywhere; and that which
increases the difficulty is, that the authors of our old chronicles were only
acquainted with the kingdom of Jerusalem, and knew nothing of what

contrary, take much more note of the expeditions of the interior than of
the events that happened at Ptolemaïs, situated on the sea-coast, and in

Notwithstanding the partiality I naturally feel for an author whose
work I am translating, and to which task I was led by my admiration of
it, I cannot allow such opinions of the war against the Albigeois to pass
unnoticed. A very sensible French historian says:&mdash;“The inhabitants
of these provinces were industrious, intellectual, and addicted to commerce,
the arts, and poetry; their numerous cities flourished, governed
by consuls with forms approaching to republican; all at once this beautiful
region was abandoned to the furies of fanaticism, its cities were ruined,
its arts and its commerce destroyed, and its language cast back into barbarism.
The preaching of the first religious reform gave birth to the
devastation of these rich countries. The clergy were not distinguished
there, as in France or the northern provinces, by their ardour to improve
themselves and diffuse knowledge; they signalized themselves by gross
disorders, and sank daily into greater contempt. The need of reform
had been long felt among the people of Provence and many reformers
had already appeared. For a length of time associations had existed whose
aim it was to purify the morals and the doctrines of the Church; such
were the Paterins, the Catharins, and the Poor of Lyons; and the greater
part of these had obtained the sanction of the popes, who considered them
as so many orders of monks, highly calculated to awaken public devotion.
But the reforms that were operated extended gradually; dogmas even were
attacked, priests were subjected to the insults of the people, and the
domains of the Church were invaded. Such was the state of things when
the famous Innocent III., at the age of thirty-nine, ascended the pontifical
throne in 1198. To his great task he brought the talents of an ambitious,
and the energy of a violent and an inflexible character. This pontiff, who
dominated over Europe by indulgences and excommunications, watched
for and punished with severity every free exercise of thought in religious
matters; he was the first to feel how serious and threatening for the
Church of Rome that liberty of mind must be that had already degenerated
into revolt. He saw with great inquietude and anger the new tendency
of men’s minds in Provence and Languedoc, and proscribed the reformers,
the most numerous of whom, and who gave their name to all the others,
were known under the names of Albigeois and Vaudois. Some among
them were Manicheans, that is to say, admitted the two principles; <i>but
the greatest number of them professed doctrines differing but very little
from those which, three centuries later, were preached by Luther</i>. They
denied transubstantiation in the sacrament of the Eucharist, rejected confession,
and the sacraments of confirmation and marriage, and taxed the
worship of images with idolatry.” In this war papacy put forth all its
most dreaded powers; indulgences to its brutal, mercenary soldiers;
heaven for wholesale slaughterers of their fellow-creatures; hell for all
who dared to think when they worshipped, or to breathe a word against
the veriest nonsense of Romish rites: many instances occurred in which
the odious doctrine of <i>no faith to be observed with heretics</i>, was unblushingly
advanced and cruelly acted upon. I will close my notice of this
war against men who ventured to entertain a shade of difference in opinion
from their fellow-Christians and the head of the Church, by a quotation
that vividly stamps its character. “The Crusaders precipitated themselves
in a mass upon the lands of the young viscount de Béziers, took
his castles and burnt all the men, violated the women and massacred the
children they found in them; then, turning towards Béziers, they carried
it by assault. A prodigious number of the inhabitants of the circumjacent
country had taken refuge in this city; the abbot of Citeaux, legate of the
pope, upon being consulted by the knights as to the fate of these unhappy
beings, a part of whom only were heretics, replied by these execrable and
ever-memorable words: ‘<i>Kill away! kill away! God will take care of
his own!</i>’” The crusade against the Albigeois is one of the blackest
pages in the history of mankind, and ought to be described as such by
every historian whose disagreeable duty it is to name it.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Trans.</span></p>

The abbot of Vaux-de-Cernai, who signalized himself in the crusade
against the Albigeois, has left us a history of this period, in which he
relates with an air of triumph, facts which passed before his eyes, at which
religion as well as humanity ought to blush. When we have read his
account, we are persuaded of two things: the first, that he was sincere in
the excess of his fanatical zeal; the second, that his age thought as he did,
and did not disapprove of the violences and persecutions of which he so
candidly exposes the history. Le Père Langlois, a Jesuit, has written, in
French, a history of the crusades against the Albigeois. The <i>Histoire
Ecclésiastique</i> of Fleury, and <i>L’Histoire de la Province de Languedoc</i>
may be consulted with advantage.</p>

Gibbon says: “Some deep reasoners have suspected that the whole
enterprise, from the first synod at Placentia, was contrived and executed
by the policy of Rome. The suspicion is not founded either in matter or
fact. The successors of St. Peter appear to have <i>followed</i>, rather than
<i>guided</i> the impulse of manners and prejudice.” With great respect for
our illustrious historian, I cannot quite agree with him; the popes were in
many instances the first to kindle the flame, and were always anxious to
keep it burning. In the part of our history now before us, it is plain it
would have gone out but for the great exertions of Innocent. The
crusades were a powerful engine in the hands of the popes; they could
not afford to let them go to decay.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Trans.</span></p>

In the royal regulations of Philip Augustus, there is an order relative
to the debts contracted by the Crusaders as members of a commune. We
think our readers will not be displeased by the particulars of this order.
“As to the Crusaders, members of certain communes, we order,” says the
king, “that if the commune itself be charged with any levy, whether for
foot or horse soldiers (l’ost et la chevauchée), the inclosure of the city,
the defence of the city in the event of a siege, or for any debt that is
due, and contracted before they took the cross, they shall be held subject
to the payment of their proportion, equally with the other inhabitants who
have not taken the cross; but as to the debts contracted after the period
at which they shall have taken the cross, the Crusaders shall remain
exempt, not only until their approaching departure, but until their
return.”&mdash;See the <i>Recueil des Ordonnances</i>, <i>Dachery</i>, and the sixth vol.

I have observed more than once, that our author is so absorbed in
the history he has undertaken, that he is somewhat loose in his remarks
upon that of the nations nearest to him. It was not likely that Henry III.,
a boy of nine years old, should take the cross, or that the prudent Pembroke
and his other counsellors would allow the forces of an unsettled
kingdom to be wasted upon such a scheme. The king of France again,
who he says was constantly occupied in the war against the Albigeois,
had absolutely nothing to do with that war. The southern provinces
subjected to this calamity were fiefs of the crown of Aragon, and did not
belong at that time to France in any way. Whilst these wars were raging,
Philip was prudently extending his dominions to the north and north-east.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Trans.</span></p>

The Chronicle of Peter Durburg, a priest of the Teutonic order, may
be consulted on the manners and religion of the ancient Prussians. This
chronicle, whose purpose is to describe the conquests of the Teutonic
knights, contains several historical dissertations, which appear to us to
have great merit; the most curious are, <i>Dissertatio de Diis Veterum
Prussorum</i>; <i>Dissertatio de Sacerdotibus Veterum Prussorum</i>; <i>Dissertatio
de Cultu Deorum</i>, <i>de Nuptiis</i>, <i>de Funeribus</i>, <i>de Locis Divino Cultui dicatis</i>,
&amp;c. &amp;c. A Latin dissertation, <i>De Moribus Tartarorum, Lithuanorum,
et Moschorum</i>, may likewise be consulted. This work contains curious
details upon the worship and manners of Lithuania and Samogitia, which
bore a strong resemblance to the worship and manners of the Prussians.
M. Kotzbue, in his history of the Teutonic knights, has thrown great
light upon the origin of the legislation, and the customs and religion of
the ancient inhabitants of Prussia.</p>

Le Père Maimbourg and most historians make the king of Hungary
embark at Venice; but they are unacquainted with the Chronicle of

of Andrew II. into the Holy Land, and his return to his dominions. This
Chronicle, it is true, contains many doubtful things concerning the crusade,
and the kingdom of Hungary on the return of Andrew; but it is quite
worthy of confidence in all that passed at Spalatro.</p>

“This year,” 614 of the Hegyra, says the continuator of Tabary, “the
Franks received succours by sea from Rome the great, and other countries
of the Franks, both west and north. It was the chief of Rome, a prelate

from his own country under various commanders, and he ordered the other

It is our duty to quote here what is met with in the continuator of
Tabary, or the false Tabary, relative to this expedition of the Christians:
“They undertook to besiege the castle of Thour (Tabor), and reached
the top of the mountain and the foot of the walls. They were very near
becoming masters of it; but one of their princes being dead, they retired,
after having remained seventeen days before the fort.” This account is
quite contrary to that of the western historians, and otherwise bears no
mark of probability. It is true that the king of Cyprus died during this
campaign of the Crusaders; but he died at Tripoli, and more than a month
after the expedition of Mount Tabor.</p>

viresque redire nequiverit. Another historian adds, that the

that Benedict, the chancellor of Queen Yollande, had difficulty in persuading
a few prelates to go out and meet him.</p>

Savary has rectified an error committed by several learned moderns,

caliph of Bagdad, who was the apostle of the Saracens, and implored him,
in the name of Mahomet, to assist him, assuring him that if he did not
assist him, he should lose his dominions. For the apostle of Rome sent
so many people that they were beyond all count or measure, and that the
caliph must order preaching throughout Paganism as was practised in
Christendom, and he might send the sultan great assistance in consequence
of his preachings.”</p>

Alhékari, surnamed Ibn-almachtoub (son of the Scarred),
on account of a wound which had marked his face. The same chronicle adds
that the emir, the son of the Scarred, despised the futile things of kings,
and that most extraordinary circumstances were related of his revolts
against sovereigns.</p>

The infantry must have rendered, during the siege, greater services than
the cavalry, in defending the intrenchments, mounting to the assault, or
fighting on board the ships. This dispute alone proves that the infantry
had made great progress; for till that time they would not have dared to
compare themselves with the cavalry.</p>

Li soudan dist qu’il avait archevesques et évesques de sa loi, et sans
eux ne pouvoit-il crier ce qu’ils diraient. Les clercs lui respondirent:
“Mandez les guerre;” et ils vinrent à lui en sa tente. Si leur conta ce que
li clercs li avaient dist; ils respondirent: “Sire, tu es épée de la loi. Nous
nous te commandons, de par Mahomet, que tu lor fasse la teste couper.”
A tant puient congé, si s’en allèrent. Li soudan demora et li dist clercs,
dont vint li soudan, si lors dist, “Seignors, ils m’ont commandé, de par
Mahomet, et de par la loi, que je vous fasse les testes couper; mais j’irai
en contre le commandement,” &amp;c. &amp;c. The sultan&mdash;we translate our old
historian&mdash;said he had archbishops and bishops of the law, and without
them he could not listen to what they had to say. The clerks, St. Francis
and his companion, answered him, “Send for them here”&mdash;and they
came to him in his tent. He then related to them what the clerks had
said, and they answered: “Sire, thou art the sword of the law. We command
you, by Mahomet, to order their heads to be cut off.” They then
made their obeisance and went away. The sultan and the said clerks
remained. Then the sultan came towards them, and said, “Seignors, they
have commanded me, by Mahomet, to order your heads to be cut off; but
I shall act contrary to the commandment,” &amp;c. &amp;c. The historian adds,
that the sultan offered them presents, which they refused&mdash;he ordered
them refreshment, and sent them back to the Christian army.</p>

The Chronicle of Ibn-ferat gives some details of this council of the
Mussulman princes. The Western historians say nothing of it. It is a
pity that James of Vitri, who was sent to the camp of the Saracens to
propose the capitulation, should have preserved a profound silence upon
so important a circumstance. We have several times remarked that the
Arabian historians, when the Mussulmans experience reverses, content
themselves with saying, “<i>God is great; may God curse the Christians!</i>”
We find the same inconvenience in the Western historians, who are almost
always silent when the Christians are conquered.</p>

King John was a bad prince: he inspired mistrust in his subjects,
who demanded a pledge of him, and this pledge became the English
constitution. If France, before the revolution of 1789, had never asked
her kings for a pledge, it was because none of them had inspired mistrust
in his people: the best eulogy that can be made upon the kings of France
is, that the nation had never felt under their government the want of a
written or guaranteed constitution, and that they were in all times considered
as the safest guardians of the public liberty.</p>
<p class="pfc4">[It is scarcely conceivable how a writer of the nineteenth century could
offer his readers such opinions as these (both text and note). Some of
the best portions of British liberty were obtained from better kings than
any France had, with the exception of Henry IV., from Louis IX. to the

his History of the Huns, has spoken at great length of the Tartars and of
Gengiskhan; he announces that he has deviated from the account of Petis
de Lacroix; but as he does not always name the sources from which he

According to what we know of Gengiskhan, we should with difficulty
believe that among modern historians he has been able to find panegyrists;
but Petis de Lacroix has not been able to avoid the example of most historians,
who generally appear infatuated by the hero whose life they are
writing. An Arabian historian relates, that on learning the massacre of
his ambassadors, Gengiskhan was not able to refrain from tears. Here
Petis de Lacroix is very angry with the Arabian, and reproaches him
bitterly with having given the emperor of the Moguls <i>a feminine</i> character.
All others, says he, have given a portrait of him more worthy of a hero.</p>

There have been long disputes upon the terms Mogul and Tartar.
We think we can make out, amidst much uncertainty, that the Moguls
originally formed a distinct tribe of the vast countries of Tartary; and
that the Tartars, being in great numbers in the armies of the conquering
Moguls, obliterated in a degree the names of their conquerors in the kingdoms
of Europe and Asia to which these armies penetrated.</p>

We find in the great theology of Tournely (<i>Traité de l’Eglise</i>, tom. ii.)
a very learned dissertation upon this deposition of the emperor Frederick II.
at the first council of Lyons. This theologian asserts that the council
had nothing at all to do with this great act of authority of Innocent IV.,
and brings several reasons to support his opinion. We will quote some
of them, leaving our readers to appreciate their value.</p>
<p class="pfc4">“Whilst all the bulls of the pope, published in council, begin by
these words: ‘We have decreed, with the approbation of the council,
according to the advice of the sacred council, &amp;c. (sacro approbante
concilio, ex communi concilii approbatione, statuimus),’ we read at
the head of the bull in question: ‘Sentence pronounced against the
emperor Frederick by the pope, Innocent IV., in presence of the council
(sacro præsente concilio),’ an essential difference, which is likewise
observable in the body of the bull, when the sovereign pontiff only speaks
in his own name, and as holding the place of Jesus Christ upon earth.
All the fathers of the council, says Matthew Paris, on hearing the sentence,
<i>were struck with surprise and horror</i>, sentiments they certainly would
not have felt if they had had any part in the judgment.</p>
<p class="pfc4">“All the historians of the time attribute this act of authority to the
pope, without even mentioning the council; and Frederick II., when
accusing the incompetence of the judge, his partiality, his blindness, and
his ingratitude, when writing to the kings of France and England and the
barons of his kingdom on the subject, only complains of the pontiff, and
does not attach the least reproach to the prelates who composed the
assembly. The sentence was considered as so completely the work of the
pope, that the Church, which received the decisions of the council, attached
little importance to the bull, and that this bull became absolutely a party
affair. It was rejected by a great number of the churches of Germany
and Italy. The kings of France and England considered it as injurious to
sovereign majesty, and continued to treat Frederick as legitimate emperor.
It only rendered the wars between the Guelphs and Ghibellines more active
and more inveterate.</p>
<p class="pfc4">“The pope said truly that he had deliberated with the fathers of the
council; but he adds, that the deliberation turned upon no other object
but the excommunication of the emperor; that he did not at all speak of
the article of the deposition, and that thence came the surprise and horror
which the prelates manifested.</p>
<p class="pfc4">“It is nevertheless objected that the pope and the fathers of the council,
after the reading of the sentence, turned down the waxlights which
they held and extinguished them, and that afterwards the pope gave out
the <i>Te Deum</i>, in which the prelates assisted; but Matthew Paris believes
that the circumstances are here not exact. He thinks that some priests
only, attached to the court of Rome, lent themselves to the passion of the
pope against Frederick, and performed the ceremony of the waxlights,
which may still further only relate to the excommunication; otherwise
how can we reconcile this passage of the historian with the surprise and
horror that were manifested, according to him, in the assembly at the
reading of the sentence.</p>
<p class="pfc4">“The pope did not even endeavour to persuade anybody that he was
supported by the authority of the council. He declared that he should
know how to maintain irrevocably <i>all that he had done</i> relative to
Frederick.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">After having discussed all these points, Tournely raises doubts upon
the œcumenicity of the first council of Lyons.</p>
<p class="pfc4">“The council of Florence,” says this theologian, “which makes an
enumeration of the general councils held before that period, passes by
that of Lyons in silence, and in fact several countries, as Germany, Italy,
Spain, Brittany, Sweden, and Poland, had no bishops there; there were
few prelates from France or England.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">“In the same way the council of Constance, enumerating in a formula,
that the pope about to be elected was to sign all the œcumenic councils
which had preceded, only mentions one council of Lyons. Now, this
could only be the second, for that was very solemn. There were more
than five hundred bishops at it, as well from the East as the West, and
the Greeks in it acknowledged <i>the divine filiation</i>.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">Thadæus of Suesse, representative of the emperor Frederick II. at the
council of Lyons, and zealous defender of the rights of that prince, appealed
publicly from this council to a future general and <i>œcumenic</i> council. One
of the causes which might, according to Tournely, lead several bishops
into error, but which will appear very strange at the present day, was,
that they imagined the empire really was a feudatory of the court of Rome.
It is the sovereign pontiff, they say, who crowns the emperor; he has then
a particular and special right over the empire; he can depose the head of
it for a serious matter. Frederick, in his letters to the kings of France
and England, mentions and combats strongly this ridiculous prejudice,
and the foolish pretensions of the popes. Gregory IX., in a letter
addressed to Stephen, archbishop of Canterbury, informs him that
Frederick is engaged by oath to go to the Holy Land, abandoning, if he
failed in his promise, his states and his person to the sovereign pontiff.
According to this, the fathers might believe that the deposition was a consequence
of the penalty the prince had incurred as a perjurer. We must
refer to the ages in which these questions were agitated to appreciate the
influence they had upon events.</p>

This great incident in the life of Louis IX. is differently, and indeed
more strikingly, related by most French historians. “When he felt himself
better, to the great astonishment of all, he ordered the red cross to
be affixed to his bed and his vestments, and made a vow to go and fight
for the tomb of Christ. His mother, and the priests themselves, implored
him to renounce his fatal design. It was all in vain; and scarcely was
he convalescent than he called his mother and the bishop of Paris to his
bedside, and said to them, ‘Since you believe that I was not perfectly
myself when I pronounced my vows, there is my red cross, which I tear
from my shoulders; I return it to you: but now, when you must perceive
that I am in the full enjoyment of all my faculties, restore to me my cross;
for He who is acquainted with all things, knows also that no kind of food
shall enter into my mouth until I have again been marked with His holy
sign. ‘It is the hand of Heaven,’ cried all who were present; ‘its will
be done.’” (<i>Bonnechose</i>).&mdash;<span class="smcap">Trans.</span></p>

Like many good and affectionate mothers, Blanche was very jealous
of the influence of a young wife over her son. Principally for territorial
advantages, Louis married Marguerite of Provence, when he was nineteen

but after Louis had in vain tried every means of subduing the anger of
the pope, his superstitious reverence for the head of the Church prevailed
over even his good sense and his prudence, and he declined stopping in
Sicily, because that island was part of the dominions of an excommunicated
prince.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Trans.</span></p>

M. Abel-Remusat, in his learned Memoir upon the Tartars, explains
several doubtful circumstances of this embassy; he examines the opposite
versions, and does not at all adopt the opinion of M. Deguignes, who
views the Mogul ambassadors as nothing but impostors. If it may be
allowed me, after these two great authorities, to offer an opinion, I should
say that the arrival of Louis having created a great sensation in the East,
Ecalthaï, governor of all the provinces of Asia, might send emissaries to
ascertain the designs and strength of the Franks; and it may be believed
that these emissaries, to perform their mission with more success, feigned
several circumstances calculated to increase their credit in the minds of
the Christians. It appears to us that this opinion may reconcile that
which is opposite in that of the two writers quoted.</p>

Upon the battles that preceded the taking of Damietta, and upon the
taking of that city, Joinville may be consulted, as the historian that furnishes

At this period the national troops had neither the courage nor the
constancy that the labours of war require. The Arabs, who had entered
Egypt as conquerors with Amron-Ben-al-As, had disappeared, without
leaving successors capable of supporting their reputation. There were no
means of recruiting the army but by slaves bought in the north of Asia
and in Europe, or by wandering Arabs, who, accustomed to a hardy,
active life, still showed some energy. This latter measure presented
another advantage. By bringing these nomads under the yoke of military
discipline, the nations were delivered from the depredations of men who
lived by war. It was with this motive that the pacha of Egypt of the
present day has enrolled the Arabs of his states under his banners.&mdash;See

There is here an apparent contradiction between the version of
Ducange and that of MM. Melot, Sallier, and Caperonier: in the latter
we read that these five hundred Mussulmans were sent to harass the
French army, but there is no mention of a deceit, or <i>ruse de guerre</i>; in
that of Ducange, on the contrary, we find this sentence: “He [the
sultan] sent to the king, as a <i>ruse</i>, five hundred of his best-mounted
horsemen, they telling the king that they were come to assist him, him
and all his army.” We find nothing like this in the edition of MM.
Melot, Sallier, and Caperonier; it is probable that this sentence may have
been interpolated in the manuscript, for we cannot believe that five hundred
Mussulman horsemen could have been received as friends in the
Christian army, who stood in no need of auxiliaries, and who certainly
did not look for them among the Saracens. We avail ourselves of this
opportunity to warn our readers that the various editions of Joinville
often vary in important circumstances, and that they should at all times
be subjected to a very critical examination.</p>

This disease was the scurvy; “it was such,” says Joinville, “that
the flesh of our legs dried away to the bone, and our skins became of a
black or earth colour, like an old saddle which has been a long time laid
aside: and besides this, we who were afflicted by this disease were soon
subjected to another persecution, in a complaint of the mouth, which arose
from our having eaten of those fish; it putrified the flesh of the gums, so
that it rendered the breath horribly stinking.” Joinville here speaks of
the <i>burbotte</i>, a fish of the Nile, which is a voracious fish, and feeds upon
dead bodies. The seneschal adds, in another passage of his memoirs,
“that the malady having seized upon the army, it became necessary for
the barbers to cut out the swollen flesh of the gums of all who were
afflicted with this disease, so that they could not eat. Great pity was it
to hear all from whom this dead flesh had been cut, going about in the
army, crying and moaning. They appeared to me like poor women who
are in labour with their children when they come upon earth: nobody can
tell how pitiable that sight was.”</p>

This generous trait of St. Louis, who refused to quit his army, is
attested by both French and Oriental historians. Joinville expresses
himself thus:&mdash;“Seeing the king had the same disease as the army, and
great weakness, as others had, we thought he would be much safer on
board one of the great galleys; but he said ‘he would rather die than
leave his people.’” Geoffrey of Beaulieu, equally an eyewitness, attests
this fact. To the evidence of these two historians we may add that of
the Arabian historian Aboul Mahassem. “The king of France,” says
he, “might have escaped from the Egyptians, either on horseback, or in
a boat; but this generous prince would never consent to abandon his
troops.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">[The conduct of Louis might be imprudent, but it was noble and
heroic. The admirers of the modern French idol, Buonaparte, would be
very much at a loss to find such a trait in his history; it was always

Joinville speaks of a sum of five hundred thousand livres. Ducange
has made a dissertation on this head, that gives very little information:&mdash;in
the first place, we must be able to ascertain what was then the value of
500,000 livres of our money.</p>

This is really one of those tales that require “seven justices’ names”
to vouch for their authenticity. How such a man, at such a time, could
be ambitious of the honour of knighthood, it is very difficult to imagine.
But when we recollect that the evidence of sixty-five miracles performed
by him, was produced to procure his canonization, we must not be sceptical
in what regards Louis IX.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Trans.</span></p>

We had at first consulted the edition of Ducange; and we have been
surprised to find an account and expressions totally different in that of
Caperonier, otherwise called the edition of the Louvre; however this may
be, we cannot conclude, from either one version or the other, that any
proposal of the kind was made to Louis IX. [As the reader may like,
without trouble, to see the opinion of our great historian upon this interesting
subject, I venture to subjoin it:&mdash;“The idea of the emirs to
choose Louis for their sultan is seriously attested by Joinville, pp. 77-78,
and does not appear to me so absurd as to M. de Voltaire. The Mamelukes
themselves were strangers, rebels, and equals; they had felt his
valour, they hoped for his conversion; and such a motion, which was not
seconded, might be made perhaps by a secret Christian, in their tumultuous
assembly.”&mdash;<i>Gibbon.</i>]&mdash;<span class="smcap">Trans.</span></p>

If we compare this council with that of the Christians which sat after
the taking of Jerusalem, and the results of both, we shall be less inclined
to blame the hesitation of the Mussulmans. The Crusaders were the
invaders of the country of the Mussulmans, the assailants of their faith&mdash;can
it be wondered at if they awakened vindictive passions?&mdash;<span class="smcap">Trans.</span></p>

Among the great number of historians who have spoken of this
movement, William de Guy, Matthew Paris, William of Nangis, and the
<i>Annals of Waverley</i> may be consulted.</p>
<p class="pfc4">(Some historians relate the catastrophe differently. One says: “The
pastors were accustomed to preach, surrounded by armed men for their
defence; one day, by the command of Blanche, an executioner introduced
himself among these, and gliding behind Jacob, struck his head off at a
blow, before the eyes of the spectators, who were chilled with horror.
Some knights then appeared and dispersed the pastors.”)&mdash;<span class="smcap">Trans.</span></p>

There can be no doubt that this was the case with those who remained

to go to Antioch proves that he had no resource in Europe. It was a

M. Michaud observes this is a remarkable circumstance; but it is
much more remarkable, that whilst instructing his readers, he appears to
gather no wisdom himself. Every page of his book tells us, that though
there were many examples of sincere piety and virtue among the Crusaders,
the bulk of them were <i>adventurers</i>, to whom the most profitable
religion would be the best. He is so in love with his drama, that he
wishes to think the actors and their motives of action much better than
they are.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Trans.</span></p>

Joinville’s account is very confused here; indeed, almost unintelligible.
He says at first that the king was at Sidon, and that he retired into the
castle on the arrival of the Saracens. Two pages further on he says:
“When the king had finished the fortifying of Jaffa, he formed the intention
of doing the same for Sidon as he had done for Jaffa.” We cannot
fail to observe a contradiction here. We can suppose that Louis had
been to Sidon, had left it, and had again returned; but one circumstance
proves the contrary. History says that two thousand Christians were
killed at Sidon, or in the vicinity of that city; if Louis had then been
upon the spot, it is most probable he would have buried the dead before
his departure, and would not have deferred the performance of this pious
duty till his return. It is evident that Joinville’s account has been
altered at this part; unfortunately, this alteration is not the only one
which this precious historical monument has undergone.</p>

It is not uninteresting or barren of instruction, to think how different
would be the reflections of a Voltaire or a Gibbon on this subject! The
reader may safely take a position between the two extremes: Louis was a
good and pious man, but a very mistaken one; as king of a great people,
he certainly had not performed his duties during the last five years.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Trans.</span></p>

But there is one piece of internal evidence in this tradition, that we
think should obtain it credit, notwithstanding the silence of history.
When we remember how the European armies in Egypt, at the end of the
last century, suffered from <i>ophthalmia</i>, we think there is strong reason to
believe that Louis might found such an institution on his return.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Trans.</span></p>

One thing worthy of remark is, that the emperor Frederick resembled
closely, both in character and policy, Frederick II., king of Prussia; but
the latter was in harmony with his age, and his age has named him the
